PREFACE.


The haste in which the former edition of this little journal was written
and sent to the press, produced several errors and omissions, which,
in this, I have endeavored to correct and supply; adding, also, a
short account of the situation, population and customs of those places
mentioned in the narrative.

No spectacle on earth, perhaps, which the eye of man can witness, is
fraught with so much interest, sublimity and terror, and no situation
is so awful and appalling, as a midnight shipwreck at sea. In my youth,
I read, with unsatiated avidity, the voyages and disasters of the
adventurous seaman, and I believe the desire for such information is
planted in every human heart.

The remarkable event of one only surviving, in a total shipwreck,
naturally awakens a curiosity to learn the particulars, and by what extra
chances he alone fortunately reached the shore. The following is a tale
of this complexion,

    ‘Torn from the bosom of the raging sea.’

A few words in its defence are now necessary. Several persons have
indirectly expressed their disbelief, totally or in part, of the
events I have related, and have probably been so induced, from a few
strained expressions which occur in the relation. These should have been
overlooked in a tale which should have been penned with

    ‘Thoughts that breathe and words that burn.’

That a ship of the name and description mentioned in these pages, sailed
from such port, at such time, with such a company, and freighted with
such a cargo, as I have described; that said ship never reached her port
of destination; and that some time afterwards, the wreck of a large
vessel was discovered on the shores of the La Plata; are facts which no
one, I presume, will deny, for they can be easily and readily proved. If
thus far is admitted, what remains to doubt?

It is the events, then, related in the interim, in which I was
ultimately, and for some days, sole actor, which savors of the
marvellous. But is it so incredible, that in a storm where twenty two
perished in a short time and in a fearful manner, and but one escaped,
that that one should be beset with peril, should win his way, with great
difficulty, to the shore, and suffer the disasters he has attempted to
describe? I have said thus much to destroy these surmises, which, though
indirect and untenable, are grating to the feelings. The nature of this
part of the case precluding the possibility of ocular evidence, I can
only pledge, in support of its truth, my word of honor. All else relating
to the ship may be confirmed by the testimony of several gentlemen now
living in neighboring towns, who were merchants resident at Buenos Ayres
at the time, and who were well acquainted with the transactions, which
were never doubted there. But enough—while others may stagger at the
story, and wonder that he alone should survive; with him, that he escaped
at all, will be the theme of the greatest wonder, and of the deepest
gratitude.

NARRATIVE.


I sailed from New York in the ship Ocean, Captain. F., October, 1816,
for the River of Plate. The patriot consul from the republic of Buenos
Ayres, resident there, had contracted with and engaged a French officer
of rank, with eighteen others, who were under his direction, for the
service of his government. This personage had been formerly a colonel
under Bonaparte, and commanded a regiment of Polish lancers—himself, by
birth a Pole. He had accompanied Napoleon to Plymouth in the Bellorephon,
and being denied a passage with him to St. Helena, left England, and
sailed, with several inferior officers, to the United States. Here they
were engaged, as before mentioned, by the envoy. Our ship was fitted
out for their reception, and owned by Mr. H., then high sheriff of New
York. Besides these, we had eight other Frenchmen as passengers, who were
mechanics, architects, &c., and three Americans, comprising, with the
ship’s crew, a goodly company of about forty seven persons. We loosed the
sails, with a moderate breeze and fair, though somewhat hazy. Nothing
material occurred till the third day out, when we experienced a storm,
which lasted, with great violence, about three hours; about dark it
abated. We had got the ship under snug sail, and wearied with the labor
of the day, I retired with the chief mate below, intending to broach a
wine pipe, of which we had two stowed on end, under the after hatchway,
to drink farewell to our homes and success to our ship. On proceeding
from the cabin, through a passage to the steerage, we discovered by the
lantern, a face which I had not before recognised on board. The man
was decently dressed, sitting between the water casks, picking a bone.
On being interrogated, he told us he was an Irishman, of the name of
O’Brien; that bad luck had brought him there, having lost his money; and
that he had smuggled himself on board. I acquainted the captain with the
discovery, and the affair terminated by setting him to work as cook’s
mate; in which capacity he afterwards proved a very useful fellow. The
interference of the French passengers in the affairs of the ship, gave us
much trouble, for which the tars paid themselves on crossing the line.

It had been reported in the papers of the day, at New York, previous to
our sailing, that the Portuguese had declared war against the patriots
of the La Plata, had seized on Monte Video, and were blockading the
port of Buenos Ayres. On Sunday morning, eighty two days out, we passed
Monte Video, in full sight, with a stiff breeze. The day was bright and
beautiful, and the appearance of this walled city as we were borne along
upon the bosom of the majestic La Plata, was to us, who so long had seen
nothing but the ocean and the sky, highly gratifying. Abreast of the
harbor, lay a Portuguese seventy four and several frigates; we ran within
cannon shot of the former, she firing one gun, which we did not regard,
but continued our course in an oblique direction across the river, to
gain the south channel. About four, P. M., we discovered the opposite
shore, and ran within three miles of it, when we struck upon a shoal; the
bottom, fortunately, was of soft mud, though the swell of the sea caused
the ship to strike very heavily. We imagined it to be the Chico Bank,
as we thought Point India Shoal, which, in fact, we were thumping upon,
could not extend so far from the land; the helmsman was therefore ordered
to keep the ship’s head in shore, in order to pass between the bank and
the main; but this movement soon caused her to strike so heavily as to
throw three or four off their legs, and much alarmed the passengers. On
perceiving our error, we immediately braced round the sails and steered
off shore, and after striking again several times, found ourselves once
more in deep water. The navigation at this part of the river is very
difficult and dangerous. Night approaching, we soon after lessened sail
and came to anchor in about ten fathoms, and remained thus for the night.

At day break we again loosened the sails and proceeded up the river.
Capt. F. and the general were upon the look-out aloft, greatly anxious
for the result of this day’s proceedings; the Frenchmen dreading the
Portuguese, and expecting hourly to be boarded by a man of war and taken
prisoners, and the captain also concerned for the safety of his ship.
At ten, A. M., they discovered, from aloft, several vessels, far ahead,
which, enveloped partly in the floating mist of the morning, loomed like
men of war. The merchant vessels in the outer roads of Buenos Ayres are
discovered before you can see the city, from which they are distant
eight or ten miles; where, also, is stationed, at all times, an English
frigate or sloop of war. These, I assured the agitated Frenchmen, were
the ships they now saw; but their fears construed them into the dreaded
Portuguese squadron, and their opinion could not be shaken. The captain
ordered the ship to be brought to. The sails were clued up, the anchor
dropped, and the long boat hoisted out and got alongside. While doing
this, I was sent for in the cabin, where the captain requested me to
get in readiness, with four men, to go in the boat and take the French
officers on shore. They seemed convinced, he said, that the ships ahead
are enemies, and are willing to take the chance of landing here, rather
than to fall into their hands. I received some dollars to pay expenses,
immediately mustered the baggage of the soldiers, and with the general
and nine others, pushed off from the ship and made for the shore, distant
about five miles. We landed about four, P. M., running the boat on the
beach, as she had leaked half full of water, and commenced unlading the
cargo, which comprised all the officers’ trunks, bedding, armour, side
arms, &c., and a small stock of provisions. These were carried through
the bushes to an elevated spot, where there grew a thicket of small sized
trees, by the help of which, the passengers began to erect a kind of
arbor, while I left them, with two of the seamen, to explore the country,
which, probably, before we landed, the human foot had never trod. The
soil we found very wet, and almost impenetrable from the thick growth
of tall reeds. I saw, over the rushes, afar off, a rising ground and a
tree, and thinking it would be a good place for further observations,
I resolved to gain it. Our only method of advancing was by parting the
rushes on each side with our arms, and breaking through the bushes or
creeping under the small trees, which grew here in the thick luxuriance
of unmolested nature. But for the greatest distance, our only method of
progressing was, to lay ourselves at length on the rushes and pressing
them to the ground, to proceed again alternately. We gained, at last, the
desired eminence, and I ascended the tree, but could perceive nothing of
a habitation or cattle, though we had seen the prints of animals’ feet.

By the time we returned, we found the wind, which had been increasing,
now blew a gale on shore; a large surf was rolling in upon the beach,
which at once convinced us of the impossibility of making our way through
it in our leaky boat, back to the ship; we were therefore compelled to
make the best of necessity, and to remain on shore; I directed the men
to bring the boat into a small cove which made into the land, and the
anchor to be carried up the beach and secured. She then rode in her
little bay in safety. It now began to thicken around and to grow dark
and tempestuous, which urged us to turn our thoughts to the means of
shelter and comfort, during what foreboded a dreary, cold and stormy
night. We took a scanty supper of some cold ham and ship bread, and one
bottle of brandy, which nearly consumed our stock of provisions; then,
at the suggestion of the general, all hands turned to in cutting down
armfuls of the long rushes which grew so thick around, to serve for beds,
and in breaking down the branches of decayed trees, &c., for fuel. The
ground was every where very wet, and no dry spot could be found; these
rushes we strewed very thickly on the ground, in the most open place we
could find, in the form of a circle, upon which we were to repose. In
the centre of this we made half a dozen large fires, and then set the
watch, myself and four seamen, as we concluded to let the soldiers do as
best pleased them, which watch was to commence at twelve, midnight, till
which time I was to keep guard; after which, the sailors two hours each,
till morning. This was necessary in order to keep the fires replenished,
for it was freezing cold, to protect us from wild beasts, and to take
care of our boat. At twelve I called the next in turn and laid down, to
try the experiment, if weariness could repose upon a flint, for I had
a stone for my pillow, or what was worse, upon the wet ground. I had
no outside covering, neither had the seamen, but labor compelled us to
sleep. I awoke about day-light, and my feelings were indescribable; the
morning was boisterous, the fires were wholly extinct, and had been so a
long time. The men from fatigue had fallen into a deep sleep, and snoring
around. I attempted to rise, but was surprised to find my limbs so stiff
and nerveless; my senses too seemed almost as stiff as my bones, I felt
light headed, and half crazy, the effect of sleeping on wet ground. I
walked round in search of the general, who was lying with his associates
in a cluster, on the opposite side of the fires, well sheltered from
the severity of the night and the earth, by their mattresses, and ample
coverings of surtouts, cloaks and wrappers. I acquainted him of my
intention of returning on board the ship. He then pencilled a note to
Captain F. informing him he was resolved to endeavor to penetrate by
land to Ensenada, and from whence, should he arrive there, to send down
a conveyance for his men. We then pushed off with the boat, and after
a long and strong pull reached the ship; on entering on board we found
but two men, the captain and cook; the seamen wearied by the preceding
night’s fatigue, had turned in. Many congratulations passed at meeting
again, with the seamen, as each party knew it had been a hard night to
both. A part of one cable was hauled in upon the forecastle. The captain
informed me he had lost the best bower, and was resolved to remain no
longer in the river with but one anchor; he requested me, therefore,
to take the remaining Frenchmen on shore and make for Ensenada by land
or water, as soon as convenient. As the wind was fair up the river, he
should directly weigh and set sail, stating that if once rid of the
troublesome Frenchmen he had nothing to fear.

The remaining party was soon collected and seemed unwilling to go
on shore through fear of falling into Portuguese hands. These we
likewise landed on the beach, being all the French passengers. The ship
immediately threw out her sails and was soon out of sight. Most of these
officers had been troublesome guests, and were discontented, insolent,
and heartily disliked by the ship’s company; but one of a captain’s
rank, was of a different mould; he was frank and intelligent, fine form
and features, and by his gentlemanly deportment, and many virtues,
had endeared himself throughout the passage to us Americans. To him,
in Spanish, on stepping on shore, I addressed myself relative to our
situation and prospects. The general with his servant had left them in
the morning to penetrate his way to Ensenada, as before intended. While
speaking to this officer, a quarrel had arisen between his comrades and
the four sailors, which we endeavored to quell. The captain remonstrated
in vain, and they had proceeded to blows, and the first party being now
joined by the others, were running for their arms, which hung on the
arbor above, and serious consequences were likely to ensue. I therefore
deemed it prudent to leave them to their fate, and hastily shook hands
with my friend, and ordered the men to jump into the boat and pull
away. It was instantly done, and we had gained a considerable distance
before our adversaries had reached the beach. Astonished at this sudden
and unexpected movement, they hallooed and loaded us with threats and
imprecations; but disregarding all, we laid in our oars, and hoisted a
large lug mainsail, and kept foaming on our way, the wind being fresh and
fair; and shaping our course for Ensenada, we kept steadily along the
shore, though at a considerable distance from it, on account of shoals.
I had previously been in the above place four years before, in 1812; I
was well acquainted with the entrance, the several creeks, and a number
of the villagers. In a short time after our departure with the boat,
while sailing rapidly with a stiff breeze, one of our men discovered
abreast of us, on a pole, a signal of a white handkerchief, displayed in
one of the nooks or windings of the beach. I directly stood in shore to
ascertain what was meant, and as we neared the strand, we discovered to
our great surprise, the party of artizans which we had last landed from
the ship, and who had left us immediately on landing, to plod their way
on foot along shore, to our place of destination. So great was their
eagerness to reach the boat, that many waded up to their chins in water,
and nearly capsized us in their hurry to tumble on board. They gave us
a direful account of their progress over the rocks, puddles, flints,
&c. of the beach, having to trudge barefoot, with their shoes in their
hands, as the ground was so interrupted and broken, that they were often
up mid-deep in water in wading from one point of land to another. Indeed
the contortions of faces, and lacerated feet, gave strong evidence of
very rough treatment. After a rapid run of about an hour, we saw the
entrance of Ensenada, and by cutting through a small creek across a point
of land, soon found ourselves in the channel; by the appearance of the
rushes it was nearly high water, and we soon pulled up along side of a
dismantled ship, and saw several others. I directly ascended on board,
but found no one on deck; on entering the cabin, I saw at the bottom of
the companion way, a foreigner smoking his cigaro de papel. I inquired
in Spanish what ship, &c. and if the Portuguese were blockading Buenos
Ayres? ‘Nothing like it,’ he answered in Portuguese, but that they had
possession of Monte Video, and a small squadron there. Highly gratified
with this intelligence, and eased of our apprehensions, we left her
and struck into a small creek which led up to the village; here we
lowered the mainsail, and took to the oars, as the creeks are here very
irregular and narrow, and we in rowing struck each bank with our oars.
After pulling about a quarter of a mile, we fell in with a boat with two
persons in the stern, and rowed by two seamen, who, with the boat, looked
like American. I instantly recognised one of the gentlemen as a Mr. B.,
who I had formerly been well acquainted with in Buenos Ayres. ‘Where in
the name of wonder, my friend,’ he asked, ‘are you from, with that dismal
set of fellows?’ ‘From New York,’ I replied. ‘What! in that boat?’ (for
he had seen no ship) ‘Oh no! we landed a score of Frenchmen about four
leagues below, for fear of the Portuguese, and the passengers are some
of them, which we picked up along shore.’ The boats were now alongside
together, and my friend B. introduced me to Captain B., of the ship A.,
of Baltimore, then lying in the channel waiting freight. He advised me to
proceed to the captain of the port, Mr. J., to whose house they were then
going, and report myself. I thought myself fortunate in falling in, by
chance, with such good company, and on landing, we took the direct path
to the captain of the port’s house. This part of the country is extremely
low and level, insomuch as two feet above the usual tides would inundate
the country for many miles around. The houses are thinly scattered,
and the people sociable and friendly. But I shall defer a further
description for the present, and continue the story. To this officer,
the captain of the port, the second in consequence in the village, and
an American, I introduced myself, and briefly related the occurrences
which brought us into Ensenada; after some conversation, we proceeded
towards the landing place to procure accommodations for the men, whom I
left in the boat, awaiting my return. In passing by a pulperia, or small
tavern, (where they sell groceries, and can occasionally supply beds
and victuals to the lower classes) we were soon apprised by their noisy
shouts of mirth, that they were within, regaling themselves upon the
publican’s vino-carlon and sausages, and congratulating themselves on
falling in with so snug a birth after the stormy nights at sea. The port
officer agreed with the pulpero for the daily supply and lodgings for
the men while we should remain at Ensenada. From thence we visited the
commandant, who lived about half a mile from the creek. Here we found a
small party of soldiers, through which we passed, and were ushered into
the presence of the chief magistrate. He appeared to be about fifty years
of age, very corpulent, with a fat, contented face. After hearing the
story, every thing was in motion. The landing, within his jurisdiction,
of a score of friends from America, was an important affair, and happened
but rarely in this quiet village, where, in general, the greatest stretch
of his abilities and power consisted in stifling the tumultuous rows of
the sailors from the ships, on Sundays, or signing passports for Buenos
Ayres. In conjunction with Mr. J., he procured guides, horses, riders and
carts, to proceed in search of the abandoned party. As they were officers
sent out by the consul for the patriot army, he wisely considered they
had a claim upon his services and assistance.

The next morning at day break, the caravan of carts set out from the
magistrate’s in quest of the absent party, with orders to lose no
time, but to proceed till they found them, and to bring them to his
house forthwith. I now took up my abode at the house of Mr. J., where
I remained during my stay in this place. During the forenoon of the
following day, the carts returned with the wanderers. They were found in
a miserable plight, near a swamp, from which they had just extricated
themselves, covered with sweat and mud, and nearly exhausted from fatigue
and hunger. They were kept partially guarded at the commandant’s house
till an answer to his express should arrive from Buenos Ayres, to which
place he had written, relating the strange manner of their falling into
his hands. On the evening of the third day, the much expected letters
arrived. The captain of the port had instructions to permit myself and
crew to depart at pleasure, and the commandant had directions to pay
every attention to the French officers, and to furnish means to conduct
them to Buenos Ayres. Early the next morning, receiving a passport from
the captain of the port, and a small basket of provisions, to which we
added a jug of wine and keg of water, we started in our boat, (myself
and the four seamen) for Buenos Ayres. We pulled away at the oars for
about three miles, till we had doubled a point of land, when we hoisted
a sail, and were able, with the wind, to make a stretch up the river.
We kept wholly along shore, and in about five hours sail, discerned the
merchantmen in the offing of Buenos Ayres, and passed the English frigate
and native guard brig without molestation. After passing the small craft
in the inner roads to windward, in a passage of six and a half hours,
we landed at the Mole-Head. This is the only landing place, saving the
custom house, of the port. There are no piers or wharves, and the shore,
or river side, is wholly occupied by washer-women, who line the whole
surface of the beach, and who, with their black limbs and snow-white
clothes spread around, present a busy and singular appearance. I procured
lodgings for the men at a house in the street near the beach, and then
went in search of the captain, who I presumed was ashore, as we had seen
the ship in the outer roads; but he had not yet landed. In the afternoon,
however, I fell in with him near the Mole, having just landed. In the
morning a pilot was procured and we went on board; and that day the
ship, after losing her long boat, which filled and swamped while under
way, and broke her fast, was brought in to an anchor in the inner roads.

On the twenty second of February, Washington’s birth day, a phenomenon
took place at Buenos Ayres, which will ever be remembered by those who
witnessed it, and which I believe has never been recorded. On the morning
of that day, while lying off from the shore about three quarters of a
mile—the men being employed, as usual, in washing the decks, being about
half past seven, and the sun two hours high—‘Jack,’ says one of the
men to his shipmate, after he had thrown his bucket of water, and was
observing the weather, ‘what means that cloud of dust in the wake of the
town, yonder?’ Before the question could be answered by his comrade,
however, the uncommon appearance of this dense body of dust, and the wild
appearance of the sky, had rivetted the eyes of all on board. ‘Stand by
the cable tier!’ vociferated the chief mate; ‘jump down and be ready to
pay out—bear a hand, my hearties, here’s a pampero coming, driving the
world before him.’ The black cloud of dust now rising and expanding in
awful grandeur, and extending over half the horizon, rapidly approached
us, immediately followed by an immense shroud of impenetrable darkness,
which rose beneath and followed it. As the ship lay broadside to the
shore, I was proceeding from midships to the helm, in order to bring
her head to wind; but I was arrested in my progress by total darkness
and the tremendous blast, which at once, struck the ship and nearly
capsized her, and had to secure myself by clenching the railing. This is
indeed a phenomenon, I exclaimed to the chief mate; what comes next? but
astonishment kept him and all others deprived, for the time, of speech.
Here, for a few moments, was a grand and awfully sublime spectacle; on
one side of us was a body of almost palpable darkness, and on the other,
the fair light of heaven. Expecting momently to be blown to the other
regions, we waited, breathlessly, the result of this wonder of nature for
about twenty minutes, when the field of darkness passed through, and was
driven beyond us to the other side, and in its vacancy the light slowly
returned; thus we had repeatedly light on one side and darkness on the
other. On discerning the features of each other, we were surprised at
their ludicrous complexion; a sooty black dust had overspread our faces,
and rendered our appearance like that of negroes. On recovering from
our surprise, we found we had sustained no other damage than dragging
our anchors a few cables length; but other vessels, near us before, we
scarcely could recognise, they had drifted so far. The remainder of the
day was boisterous and rainy, attended with heavy thunder and lightning.
The sailors considered this event as a voice of Providence, and the
carpenter piously believed it a judgment on the sinful inhabitants of the
land. In the city, a greater degree of consternation prevailed. Many, at
the time, were in the streets, going and returning from market; but the
sudden absence of light compelled every one to remain as he was caught,
with caravans of mules, droves of horses, &c., while milk boys, priests
and begging friars, dropped on their knees and earnestly implored the
protection of the saints.

In April, the ship having altered her destination, I obtained a release,
not choosing to return home, and desirous of seeing more of the world.
Soon after, meeting with an old acquaintance, a sea captain, he proposed
to me a birth in a good ship, soon to sail to Valparaiso, in the Pacific,
doubling Cape Horn, and from thence westwardly to Canton, and returning
by the way of the Cape of Good Hope, thus completing the circumnavigation
of the globe, or the sailing round the world. This was just what I
wished, and which would occupy, probably, twenty or twenty four months.
While making preparations, however, news arrived from the Pacific,
detrimental to the sale of the cargo they were receiving on board, which
was matte or yerba, (Paraguay tea) which they were obliged to discharge;
and much to my mortification the voyage was altered. In the month of May,
however, I entered as second officer on board of this ship, the Jane,
Captain William Seaboth, bound to Brazil, with a cargo of hides. Our
departure was sometime retarded by striking on the bar, in going out,
which damaged our rudder and detained us nearly six weeks. Towards the
middle of June, however, we again set sail, and after a pleasant passage
of twenty days, came to anchor in the harbor of Rio Janeiro. Here we
had to remain nearly two months, for freight. We succeeded at last in
procuring it, consisting of nearly two hundred pipes of wine, several
hundred barrels of flour, tobacco in baskets, crockery ware, dry goods,
salmon and Irish butter in kegs, salchina, or salt pork, which is the
side of a hog rolled up hard and put in a basket of the shape of a meal
bag, &c. &c.; a very full cargo. We had on board five passengers, two
of them Spaniards, a German, an Englishman and an American, as follows:
Senior Monasteria, an eminent engineer, whose wife and four children were
living in Buenos Ayres, of which he was a valuable citizen, aged about
forty five; Senior Barras, a resident of Rio, of a weak constitution,
who had undertaken this passage on account of his low state of health,
and about twenty years of age. On the day of our departure from Rio, his
father, an aged Spaniard, who resided there, came on board to see that
every thing was prepared for his comfort, and to take a farewell of his
only son. Mynheer Mann, a German gentleman, who had been for some years
a resident of Rio Janeiro, and had before freighted vessels and taken
passage in them from thence to Monte Video; he was a man of middle age,
of prepossessing appearance, a gentleman and a scholar, and possessing
the milk of human kindness in an eminent degree. Francis Summers, a
North Briton, aged about thirty, who had likewise long resided in Buenos
Ayres, Monte Video, and Rio Janeiro, and had many acquaintances in all
those places; he was strong and athletic, of enterprising habits, and his
loss was deeply lamented. Lastly, Mr. Tiernay, an American, (naturalized)
who, I believe, was a native of France, the language of which he
spoke with ease; he was a large and well proportioned man, of great
information, and easy and sociable manners. He had left Baltimore about
a year previous, with a freight, which he advantageously disposed of at
Rio, and on the arrival of the Union, Captain P., of Boston, purchased
about four hundred barrels of flour and put on board of our vessel, which
would have brought a great price at Monte Video had our ship reached the
port.

Our captain was by birth a Dane, a large and corpulent man, a perpetual
smoker, a great eater, drank nothing but water, talked but little and
played admirably upon the piano forte, having one in his state room. He
was a man of a most phlegmatic and easy temper, upon which fair weather
or foul, bad luck or good, could make no perceptible impression. The
slaves were freshly imported, untamed sons of Angola; the seamen, (Swedes
and Englishmen) much like all other sailors, careless, illiterate, rough
and honest. We were plentifully stocked with provisions and liquors of
all kinds, such as wine, oranges, poultry, pigs, two goats for milking,
three monkies for mischief, a dog, a cat, and about twenty parrots and
paraquitos. Thus comfortably provided, in the morning of the third of
September, 1817, we were wafted out of the harbor by a cheering breeze
from the land, in company with six or eight sail of large Portuguese
Indiamen, two English ships for Lima, an English schooner for Monte
Video, and an American ship (the Diomede, of Salem, Captain Page) for
Buenos Ayres, and several coasting sumacos.

The view of this part of the Coast of Brazil, near the entrance of this
harbor is, perhaps, no where surpassed in point of majestic grandeur
and beauty. The cloud capp’t—but of this in another place. Nothing of
consequence occurred during the passage, till within about fifty leagues
of the mouth of the La Plata. About ten, A. M., on the fourteenth of
September, a man at work aloft arrested the dull, monotonous sounds of
the winds and waves, by the cry of sail ho! It was the first time we had
heard that ever welcome exclamation, and we were eager now to approach
and hail the supposed vessel. The helmsman was directed to keep in a
direct course for the sail. With a stiff breeze and fair wind we rapidly
neared it, when it began to assume a different appearance—the sails and
masts were no longer visible. The hull, however, was still plainly seen,
and looked like the wreck of some large vessel, and some, by the help of
glasses, affirmed they could distinctly perceive her broken timbers.
This was the general belief, nor were we undeceived till we were within
hail of it, when the supposed hull of a foundered frigate, proved to be
but the wreck of a prodigious South Atlantic whale! From his appearance,
he had been dead a long while; he had opened, on the upper surface, his
whole length, and presented an immense yawning breach, on each side of
which, appeared his large ribs and bones. He lay in an inclined position,
which prevented the swelling surge from entering and filling him, though
it would dash in a foam around him; this gave him, even at a moderate
distance, the appearance of a large wreck. A vast number of sea birds had
alighted upon him, and with large shoals of various fish, were eagerly
assisting to devour him.

The next day we fell in with and spoke the English brig Mary, from
Liverpool, bound to Buenos Ayres, seventy three days out. It being
about meridian, with fair weather and smooth sea, we gave the captain
an invitation to dine with us, which he accepted; and, accordingly, we
backed topsails and lay too, the brig doing the same, when we lowered the
boat from the stern, conducted him on board of us, hoisted up the boat,
filled the sails again and then bore away. This commander was dressed, as
English captains frequently are at sea, in a check shirt, short jacket,
leather cap, and tarry trowsers. A novice could not have distinguished
him from one of his crew; he was, however, sociable and friendly, had
brought a fine large Cheshire cheese with him, and took in return a half
dozen of wine. The next day we lost sight of him, he being light and a
faster sailer. The morning was rather hazy when we entered the river,
which we knew we were in, by the changed color of the water. The land was
soon plainly seen, stretching low from Cape St. Mary up the river, with
the sandy beaches, trees, and hills. We passed Lobos, or Seal Island,
about nine, A. M. These seals or sea wolves appeared at this time in
greater numbers here, than I had ever seen them. We passed Moldonado, a
small town, about eleven—continuing our course up the river with a light
but fair wind, till towards sunset, when the fog still becoming more
dense, the wind increasing and night approaching, it was determined to
haul off shore for several miles, and thus gain an offing for anchorage
during the night. We accordingly came to anchor about fifteen miles below
Monte Video, our first destined port to the leeward of Flores, or Isle of
Flowers—the wind now blowing fresh from the south east. At eight o’clock,
the gale increasing very fast, we payed out a long scope of cable, and
she seemed for the present to ride easy, and with much less straining.
Between this time and nine o’clock, while supper was preparing below, and
the crew in the forecastle, the captain and myself, with his inseparable
solace, a cigar, were walking the quarter deck, balancing ourselves to
the roll and plunges and lurches of the vessel; conversing upon the
events of the passage, the character of our passengers, and on the happy
prospects of breakfasting next morning in Monte Video. In concluding the
conversation, Captain S., after looking around upon the portentous sky
and troubled waves, made the following memorable observation. ‘But keep a
good look out to-night, Mr. F., and tend well the cable, for if we drive
ashore here, we are all lost.’ We then descended the cabin, giving charge
to the watch, and sat down with light and still happy hearts, to supper.
Happy were we all in the idea of being so near the end of our voyage—but
how unconscious that the supper we partook of, was the last to be taken,
and that six brief hours should end the voyage of life with all, save
one. Little, for my own part, did I dream of or presage its sad reality.
I had formed plans, which, on shore with my adventurers, were brilliant
in prospective, and I indulged in pleasing reveries. After the removal of
the cloth, wine was passed around, and the cabin at this time presented
a group of happy and expecting mortals, who, after the dangers of the
ocean, and almost in hail of their homes, were congratulating themselves
upon the fair prospect of the pleasures before them.

I ascended on deck, to observe the weather before I turned in. The gale
still continued to increase—the ship pitching very heavily, plunging bows
under, and wet from fore to aft by the sea and the spray. After seeing
all snug, and leaving the deck in charge of the officer of the watch, I
descended, and turned into my hammock, stripping off only my outer great
jacket. At twelve, midnight, after passing a sleepless and anxious watch
below, with sensations as strange and uneasy as the laboring motions
of the ship, I came upon deck to relieve the watch. I went forward and
examined the cables at the hawse holes, to see if the canvas or service
needed renewing from the chafing; and seeing all was well, I returned to
the quarter deck, to the lead line. The watch which had been relieved,
had retired and turned in, and myself, boatswain and four men, remained
as the watch on deck. The ship was rolling and pitching most laborsome,
as the weather current was very strong. ‘An uncomfortable night this,
sir,’ said the boatswain, who was a great talker, ‘and infernal cold
for a warm country—faith, I must button up my monkey, and secure my
tarpaulin, if we are to stand this weather here on deck for four hours.
Whew! this is a snorter; and we must keep well aft, or else a sea from
over the bows there, will throw us off our legs, or a spray give us a
drencher to freshen our eyelids. D—n her, how she jumps and pitches;
well, for my part, give me a ship under sail, with the wind a-beam to
steady her, instead of lying here at anchor, where she tumbles about
like a chip in a frog pond.’ The moon was now about half an hour high.
From the feeling of the lead, I was fearful that the ship had been, and
was still fast drifting. The motion of the vessel and strong current,
prevented my knowing this to a certainty—while at the line, I observed
an unusual white foam to the leeward, and remarked it to the boatswain.
He replied, he thought it no more than the curling tops of the waves.
Not satisfied with this, I went aft into the yawl over the stern, and
was soon convinced they were that dread of sailors, breakers, and not
far from us. I quickly went below, and awoke the captain, who was in a
secure and profound sleep! by violently shaking him; and with a loud cry
of ‘breakers!’ aroused the passengers. I then went forward to get ready
another anchor, and several men were clearing the cable tier below. The
captain had just gained the deck, when, at quarter past twelve, the
vessel struck. The shock sunk upon the hearts of those on board, like
the summons for sudden death—and with reason. All knew that while the
ship rode clear of the ground, they were in safety; but the moment she
struck, their minutes were numbered, and death inevitable. Those below
were directly alarmed by the shock, and hurried affrighted to the deck.
Another blow soon followed—then another, and another, still more heavy.
A heavy sea soon struck over the bows, and knocked down several seamen,
and obliged them to retreat to the quarter deck. The seas began now to
break over the whole weather side, and all were palsied with horror on
looking around at the awful, prospect—the tremendous surge, and the fate
which could not be shunned. The passengers and seamen had all reached
the deck, excepting the carpenter, who lay sick in his hammock in the
steerage—some, in nothing but their shirts, and all half dressed, or
with some clothes in their hands. On seeing their perilous situation,
the clothes were dropped, and they secured their hold to the rigging—the
ship continually striking. The captain ordered the steward to secure some
articles in the cabin; he descended, but soon came up with the dismal
tidings that every thing was adrift and the cabin full of water. ‘Cut
away the masts! cut away the masts!’ he then cried out. I went forward
to the carpenter’s chest; I asked several for the axe. ‘We don’t know of
any axe, sir,’ was the answer. ‘Lord have mercy upon us.’ The seas now
forced all to secure their holds. Young Summers had gained the weather
main shrouds, nearly naked and drenched by every sea. ‘Fracker, where
are you,’ he exclaimed, in a voice of despair. ‘Here am I, Frank,’ I
replied, holding on with the rest—‘God only can help us now.’ One sailor
alone, delirious with horror that stupified others, was loud in his cries
of despair. Irritated at such cowardice in one who had been a bullying,
boisterous fellow, I told him hastily to stop his clamors, and not thus
to discourage others; that if he wished to save himself, it must be by
exertion, and not lamentation; and that the ship could, possibly, hold
together till day-light. But the others stood inanimate; and despair and
horror at their inevitable fate, deprived them of all motion, speech or
sensation of danger. The seas at this time were making complete cataracts
over every part of the ship, and perceiving I should soon have to commit
myself to the waves, I threw off my pea jacket and hat into the sea. Most
of the crew and passengers were holding firmly on the different parts
of the quarter deck, and three or four naked, shivering wretches, had
ventured partly up the shrouds, clinging with ghastly looks to the ropes,
as their last hold, from which the merciless waves were tearing them
in succession, and they were instantly overwhelmed and buried in their
bosoms.

From the time she had first struck, the sea had so completely burst over
us, that it rendered every effort of endeavoring to help ourselves,
useless and dangerous—in our first intentions of cutting the cables,
making some sail, or, at the worst, to cut away the masts, and driving
as fast as possible on shore. Such, indeed, was its sudden violence,
that nothing was soon thought of but to attempt to hold on as long as
possible, and all other efforts were impracticable and abandoned. Ten or
twelve of us, at this time, were holding on to the weather quarter rail;
every sea, a solid body of water, to which at its approach we presented
our bare heads, would immediately wash us off our legs horizontally, at
arm’s length, and the comrade at my side, with several others, were torn
from their grasp, and hurled and buried amid the wreck and water.

Finding it impossible to stand this suffocating drenching any longer,
and my arms weak from such powerful stretching, I watched my chance,
after a prodigious surge roared over me, loosed my hold, seized the
mizen backstay, climbed over the heads of some who were clinging to the
rigging, and happily gained the mizen top, advising the rest to follow,
as I was certain no man could stand the force of such terrific seas five
minutes longer. Here, in the mizen top, in the interval of the ship’s
striking, I fell to thrashing myself, and preparing for the waves. My
body and limbs had become much benumbed, from the severe drenching below,
and my feet were entirely without feeling. I took off my shoes and began
to beat the soles of my feet with them; by which means, and by violently
thrashing my body with my arms, I succeeded, at last, in circulating the
blood, and rendering myself once more warm. While aloft, I drew out my
knife and cut away the gaskets which confined the mizen topsail, wishing,
by this, to drive her further towards the shore, which I could not yet
discover. I also succeeded in cutting away several of the lanyards of
the topmast rigging, hoping that the topmast might go over and leave the
mizenmast standing till the last, to hold on to; but this was unavailing,
as the keel having been beat off, the masts ultimately gave way in the
steps.

I looked down below, and beheld, with varied emotions, and not without a
degree of painful pleasure, a shipwreck, in which the fearful and the
sublime were strongly blended. It was a sight from which I could not wish
to avert my eyes, though I would have given worlds, at the same moment,
for a foothold of safety. Holding on to the topmast rigging, and bending
over the top, I watched, with straining eyes, the scene of death and
destruction, so busily and clamorously carried on beneath me. Of those
whom I had left grasping the quarter rail, I saw the three last washed
from their holds, who soon met death. The mainmast having topgallant
yard across, likewise fell over the side, and unluckily the wrong side,
being to windward, off shore, which I was sorry to see, the ship laying
broadside to the waves, and heeled much to windward. The moon had not
yet set, and though obscured, enabled me to see, distinctly, the dire
effects of the tempest. The long boat was forced from her head gripes and
fastenings, and forced round, end on, to the sea; a second wave struck
her stern, and instantly her fragments and contents were thrown beyond
me, and the small boat, astern, instantly after, followed, borne on the
top of a sea, with all her appendage of davils, tackles and lashings.
The foremast, I imagined, would now speedily fall, as from its rolling I
supposed its step was gone, as the ship beat heaviest at the fore part;
but on the contrary, I soon found myself going over with the mizen mast,
which fell and carried me along with it. I was plunged into the sea, and
received a few scratches and bruises, but happily extricated myself from
beneath the ropes, got round the top, and crawling down by the upper
rigging, with difficulty regained the ship.

I was now beset on all sides with conflicting timber, but was happily
well aware of the danger that threatened me. I found every plank of the
main deck washed off and in pieces—the bulwarks stripped and gone fore
and aft, and pipes of wine, tierces, barrels of flour and kegs of butter,
hencoops, crates and spars, added to the general wreck. In jumping from
the rail to gain the lee side, I fell among this ruin, but had hitherto
felt only one or two severe bruises. A tremendous wave now broke over
the quarter, and sweeping every thing before, carried me along with some
large spars forward, when my right leg was struck by one of them, and
jambed in between that and a deck beam, at the joint of the knee, which
was instantly crushed, and held as in a vice, immoveable. My situation
was now for two minutes most critical, and frightfully dismaying—another
sea was roaring towards me. The blow I received had almost severed my
limb, though I felt no pain. The next minute the surrounding timber would
infallibly be washed in a storm around my head and body, and I momently
expected it. By a providential rise of the water, I was enabled to catch
hold of the lee rail, screwed out my leg, dodged under the rail, tumbled
into the sea, and the wave roared harmless over my head! I did this,
not in the hope of reaching the shore, for I thought, indeed, it was
not within many miles; but resolving to hasten my end, and preferring
to die in the open sea, and especially to avoid a death by piecemeal—by
crushing now and then a joint or a limb. I had heard the groans of two
or three others, and among them, the voice of the commander; their
bones, probably, mostly broken, who had escaped being carried off by the
waves, and who were, I presumed, but just alive. These, I believed, were
all that still remained of this ill-fated company. After I had plunged
into the sea, and rose, I held on, for a moment, to the upper timbers,
which were all that was left of the ship, and those loosening, to
recover breath. I soon quitted and began to strip, which was a difficult
operation for a person in my then situation, as my leg hung down, like
a rope, useless in the water, and I had on a thick jacket, two pair of
duck trowsers, and neckerchief, a black Barcelona. While effecting this,
some one, (and the only one I discovered) clinging to the timbers, was
suddenly washed from his hold, and extending his arms, his right hand
came in contact with my neckerchief, which he convulsively grasped,
and we sunk together! Pushed for breath myself, it was no time for
ceremony—the next hold I perhaps could not disengage, and an attempt to
assist him would only ensure certain death to both; I therefore quickly
pulled the end of my neckerchief, the knot being fortunately with a bow,
and he sunk with it in his hand, and the waves closed over him forever.
I presumed he was a passenger, from his white shirt, and from his stout
appearance, the Senior Monasteria or Mr. Tiernay. While under water, I
in a moment stripped, and again rose to the surface, divested of all
covering but my shirt. My leg, I felt, was powerless, and in stripping
off my trowsers, the twisting of it gave a degree of pain, besides which,
I had several scratches and bruises; through these, the chilling coldness
of the water struck to the heart.

When a boy, I was an expert swimmer; and when arrived at manhood, could
jump from the gunwale of a ship, fully clad, strip while doubling the
keel, and come up the other side with my clothes under my arm. No one
that I had met with, possessed the faculty of retaining breath, and
withholding the respiration for so long a period. But in this case,
swimming, even with able and untired limbs, was wholly useless in a sea
so heavy; and efforts to keep my head above water was all I could hope
for. The moon had now gone down, and committing myself to God, I then
pushed off from the wreck, to be thrown by the surge where his providence
should impel. With two arms and a leg, I kept before the wind, and every
sea would wash far over my head; I resolved, therefore, to seize hold of
the first large substance I should encounter, and gain breath, of which
I was very short. I soon fastened upon a bale of goods, but it being wet
and heavy, I relinquished it, as every sea rolled over it, and I quitted
it nearly exhausted. I saw numberless pieces of the wreck, and was in
constant danger of being struck by some, which I repeatedly avoided by
paddling from and diving, which the prodigious seas wholly overwhelmed.
I stood this hard buffeting for about a dozen seas, and nature was fast
retreating from the conflict, being desperately pushed for breath, as
I could draw but little in the short intervals of the waves. I had now
been nearly half an hour in the water, and nearly half the time below it;
I had withstood, beyond my hopes, this war of elements, but my breath
now became harder and quicker—I felt a suffocation and strangling—I
turned and faced the waves in despair—I gasped twice, with a convulsive
leap—another sea swept over me—I saw death inevitable, terrible, and
face to face! I had but time, involuntarily, but audibly, to repeat the
ejaculation, ‘Lord Jesus receive my spirit,’ and sunk in unshaken faith,
that till the last trump should summon all hands, I should rise no more!
My senses with my breath, also forsook me; and for a moment my mind was
filled with the most singular and delightful sensations, apparently in an
enrapturing dream. This, however, was as momentary as it was wonderful.
I cannot imagine by what means, whether from the chill of the water,
the pain of my wounds, or by the violence of a wave that then broke
over me, but I was soon brought to my senses, and rose to the surface
evidently refreshed. Thy hand, O God, was here! On looking around, I
distinctly discovered, as if supernaturally thrown in my way, something
large and light, for it kept constantly above the waves. I exerted my
remaining strength, and reached it; it was a large crate, empty of all
but straw. Into this, I firmly clenched my fingers, and soon recovered
breath, as its buoyancy kept it high above the seas. Five minutes of this
eventful night, I never think of but with sentiments of amazement and
gratitude.—While in the act of sinking, as I supposed, for the last time,
the crowd of recollections, and the rapid succession of thoughts thronged
my brain almost to bursting, I, who two hours before, was in health,
happiness and security, now found myself in the midst of darkness, danger
and death, encompassed with the merciless element, without a gleam of
hope, and momently expecting to enter that unknown world, ‘with all
my imperfections on my head.’ The crate to which I had so fortunately
attached myself, I have reason to believe, was the only thing, by the
assistance of which, I could save my life. Keeping my hold of this, and
constantly turning it round as my weight pulled it over towards me, I
still kept courage, and dropped myself frequently down under water as
far as I could stretch at arm’s length, without quitting my hold, with
the earnest hope of touching the bottom, but without success. I was much
fatigued from exertion and anxiety, and could scarcely continue my hold
upon the crate, for every sea would sweep us at least ten feet before
it, and I began to despair of any land being near, and was fearful that
the ship had been wrecked upon a shoal; still, however, holding on the
crate, as I felt it my only hope, and knew if I lost that I was lost
indeed! Drifting along with hopeless indifference, I was beginning to
droop in despair; and overcome with exertion, I felt a lethargy creeping
over me, and resolved, with a last effort, to arouse my drowsy spirits,
and by violently shaking the crate, shook myself, and looking around, I
was surprised and animated, to find an uncommon lull and subsiding of
the swelling surge—I was once more alive, for I was inside the breakers!
I again quickly dropped myself down, eagerly stretching my limbs to the
utmost length, and with my toe touched the bottom! I felt it was of sand,
and in a few minutes more I got up to about breast high in the water, and
shoving myself forward by leg and arms, soon crawled out of the surf upon
the beach.

Thus, after being more than half an hour in the water, and making my way
for nearly three quarters of a mile, through a raging sea, at midnight,
I was at last thrown upon a desert beach, certain that no one could have
reached a cable’s length from the ship, which in an hour and a half after
she first struck, was scattered in pieces on the strand. Some idea may be
had of the violence of the elements, from the fact that not a single mast
came on shore unbroken, nor a timber as big as the windlass; and out
of twenty three souls, among whom were four stout African slaves, whose
constant habit of swimming renders them almost amphibious, only one body
was thrown on shore that night; the remainder, buried by the first wave,
came not on shore till nine days afterwards.

Amazed and nearly stunned, on reaching the beach, I attempted,
unconsciously, to stand, but my leg refused its office, and I fell
backwards to the ground and was much hurt by the fall, which caused
the blood to ooze from several wounds. Half frantic with pain and the
severe chill of the weather, a groan, as I lay extended on the earth,
for once escaped me. I groaned and wished for death; I could then, I
believe, have met him without fear—not as the king of terrors, but the
messenger of mercy; I considered the fate of my companions happier far
than my own, for their sufferings, though severe, were momentary, while
mine, perhaps, were to be protracted, till struggling nature, slowly
giving way, sunk under misery at its utmost stretch. Torments so acute
I determined not to endure; the dreaded alternative was therefore soon
chosen, and I resolved to put an end to my existence by the first means
chance should throw in my power. I had many reasons to urge me to this
desperate act. The country around me, I believed from experience on the
opposite shore, was barren and desolate, without inhabitants for a great
distance, impenetrable from swamps and shrubbery, with no chance of
being discovered; the cold was to my body deadly and fearful, and not
being able to move without torture, I should not certainly, unsheltered,
survive till the morning. The moon had set long since, and I was now in
almost palpable darkness, and I could have seen no object, though my
eyelids brushed it. Raising myself up at last, I slowly drew myself out
of the surf, by hitching myself backwards. I was seated on the sand,
with my hand groping around me, and felt hoops, or something bulky, and
found, to my surprise, a pipe of wine. I had not left the ship too soon,
for here was the lowest tier of the cargo on shore before me. Impelled by
pain and despair, I was several times on the point of knocking my head
against it and dashing out my brains, but as often hesitated, doubting
only my strength to give one sufficient blow. A sad dilemma—but God was
with me. A second thought most happily struck me; the cask was large,
and sufficient to contain me, if I could possibly stave in the head, and
lying end to the wind, would prove a complete shelter from the dreaded
cold.

Thus it pleased Providence, that the intended instrument of death, should
be the very means of my preservation! Hope once more brightened and gave
me triple vigor. Groping still farther along, I felt, for I truly could
see nothing about me, several sticks of heavy Brazil wood, dunnage to the
pipes, and taking up one, I got round to the upper head, and by repeated
strokes, made a breach and broke, with strength that surprised me, the
middle head stave. The wine burst out, I applied my mouth and drank some
of it, and then continued my strokes with renewed force. A few more blows
stove the head at last entirely in; the wine burst over me, the touch of
which, to my frozen carcase, was electric and most agreeable. I took up
two pieces of the head staves and placed them in the bottom or bilge of
the cask, to make it even and level, and then crawled in. The interior
felt to my body like an oven. I had, during all this time, been at work
partly in the water, at the edge of the surf, which now flowed in upon
me at every wave, and kept me constantly throwing it out with my left
hand, as I lay in the water on my back as the least painful position.
This labor I was obliged to continue the remainder of the night, till
towards morning; when the wind somewhat abated, the tide ebbed, and
the surf retreating, no longer kept me bailing; I was, however, too
exhausted to remove. At day break I looked out of the cask, and beheld
a long sandy beach, covered to a great extent on each side of me with
the fragments of the wreck, but not a vestige of the ship as long as the
pump, or any thing moving, excepting the gulls. In fact, I was assured,
on first reaching the shore, that no mortal alone could make his way
through such seas, in such a night, to the land. My own preservation I
considered as little short of a miracle. A shipwreck so sudden, an escape
so singular, the uproar I had witnessed, and the sight now before me,
my scattered senses could scarce conceive real. For some time I actually
doubted myself awake, for it seemed like a horrible dream. I then again
composed myself in the cask, and owing to pain, the fumes of the wine
and great exertion, I remained, during the whole of this day, nearly
insensible, and in a trance-like stupor. Towards sunset I was fearful
of being carried away by the return of the tide, during the approaching
night, with the pipe in this dangerous situation; I therefore reluctantly
crawled out of the cask, and holding up my useless leg from trailing on
the ground, and hitching myself backward with my right hand, gained at
last the foot of a sand hill further up the beach. I worked myself up on
this as high as my strength would permit, to be free from the reach of
the sea; and as night was now darkening around, I looked anxiously and
in vain, for some kind of hole into which to crawl. Finding no refuge
above ground, I was constrained to seek one below it. With a heavy heart,
I dug a bed in the sand, into which I crept, and with my lacerated leg
undermost, raking the sand over me, laid down, expecting only to rise
‘when the last trump should rouse me with its warning.’ The sand and my
shirt were my only covering; the weather was extremely cold, and during
the night it rained and stormed as hard as ever. The wet sand drifting
around in smothering showers, covered every part of me, filling at every
blast, my hair, eyes, nose and mouth, kept me constantly spitting it out
to prevent suffocation, while the cold often compelled me to sit up and
thrash myself to prevent the chill of death. About midnight, in hopes of
better avoiding the wintry wind, I resolved to shift my position, and try
to get under the lee, or into some hollow on the other side of the hill.
I accordingly crawled some distance, I knew not wither, owing to extreme
darkness, and made another hole; then thrashing my arms for some time,
again ventured to lay down, covering myself, as before, with sand, to
resist the cold. Such was my bed, and such the manner in which I passed
another night, and stood the ‘pelting of the pitiless storm.’

In the morning I looked around and observed I had got over to the other
side of the hillock, in sight of a low, marshy country, intermixed with
low shrubbery, but saw no sign of habitation or cattle. I then took
a survey of myself, and I truly looked like nothing human, or in the
likeness of any thing upon earth or the waters beneath. My wounds were
filled with sand, as were also my eyebrows, hair, beard and whiskers;
my leg swelled to the plumpness of a wool sack, my left wrist out of
joint, and the hand swelled and wholly useless; my feet were swelled and
wrinkled like tripe, from remaining so long in the water, and painful
from several wounds;[1] and a ragged shirt, torn in my struggles,
scantily covered a body discolored and sadly disfigured; I was, indeed, a
figure too shocking even to excite pity, too disabled to excite fear, and
too monstrous for any sensation but astonishment. I descended the slope
of the hill and entered among the bushes that grew around, and slowly
moved along for some time, till I espied at some distance, through the
grass, a low hollow, that I thought might contain water, for my thirst
was intolerable. In half an hour, resting at intervals, I reached it, and
found, to my great joy, that I was not deceived; it was water! clear and
tempting; but the difficulty was to get at it. I at first tried several
different plans to get my mouth to the brook, for my limbs were too lame
and stiff to bend. At last, by laying at length on the grass and rolling
up to it, I succeeded. It was the most delicious draught I ever tasted! I
drank an immoderate quantity, breathed awhile, and drank once more, not
knowing when I should drink again. Looking about me, I saw nothing but
what indicated a barren and inhospitable waste; I was therefore compelled
to wend my way over the sand, and return to my old abode; a tedious and
difficult task, which, however, I surmounted, and reached the beach about
noon. The weather was still inauspicious and cloudy, the gale not much
abated, and the sea continued to roar.

While descending the slope, I had seen among the great mass of articles
on the beach, a large empty wine pipe, which lay but a short distance
below me, with one head stove in by the sea, the other end facing the
wind and water, and the mouth near the hill, which was a snug shelter in
front. This was a fine house for me, and fortunately just what I needed.
I hitched myself towards it, entered it and laid down, being very weak
and fatigued; but I soon found the rough staves too hard for my bare
bones and bruised carcase. I shortly after sallied out in search of a
covering, and in hopes of finding some bed, mattress or blanket among
the wreck, I took a survey on each side, and saw at a distance, on my
right, something that looked like a bed, but on coming up to it, I found
only a sack of cotton wool, wet and heavy, which I could not remove;
I then returned to the cask, having reluctantly left it, as it was my
only hope. I rested awhile, and then took another survey, and soon saw,
at a great distance down the beach, on my left, towards the water, some
rolls of cotton bagging, of which we had a great number on board, and
again started out in pursuit. I was a long time in getting to them, and
then found them so buried in the sand that I was an hour in digging and
clearing it away from around them. It was now, I judged, about four, P.
M. They were two large rolls, like bed ticking, with about twenty yards
of one rolled round the other and sewed. I tore away the stitches with
my teeth and unrolled one from the other, and found the inner one still
wet. I pushed it down and rolled it along before me, hitching myself up
to it, and then pushing it from me again. Thus I got it to the cask and
across its mouth; getting into which, I unrolled eight or ten fathoms,
then laying down in the cask, pushed and spread it as well as I could
underneath me; I then unrolled as much more by the help of my feet, and
covered myself with it, though it was still wet, and covered, as was
every thing else, with sand. I now thought myself very well off, and
my situation very comfortable, compared with that of the last thirty
hours. Darkness soon came on, and during this night extreme and raging
thirst kept me awake, and pain kept me constantly shifting positions.
Such to me appeared the endless duration of the night, that for many
hours before day-break, I firmly believed, and was greatly alarmed by the
apprehension, that light would never again revisit the earth; and that
darkness had regained its primeval empire. I watched away the night in
insufferable thirst, which I thought would drive me to distraction; a
fever was raging within me, and I would have given my all for one poor
draught of water. Daylight, at last, slowly dawned forth, and as my limbs
were too feeble to undertake a journey to the watering place, I resolved
to break in upon the wine, and to search for a pipe that had its bung
inclining downwards, that the wine might flow, if I could hammer it
out. My hunger, too, was loudly craving; on my way to the wine, I found
an orange broken open and filled with sand, which I greedily devoured,
and hitched along; soon after, I fell in with a quantity of kegs of
salmon, and found one with the head out, and partly filled with sand;
nevertheless, I resolved to take it with me, and fill it with wine. I was
in fact surrounded at this place with different parts of the cargo. At
a short distance from me, strewed upon the beach, were nearly 150 pipes
of wine, kegs of butter, barrels of flour, baskets of pork, bales of
goods, &c., different fragments of the wreck without number. In passing
the kegs of butter and baskets of pork, my hunger compelled me to claw
out a handful of each, which my hunger forced down; but the wine which I
afterwards drank, soon threw it out again. Coming to the pipes, I found
one that answered, and procuring a billet of wood, struck out the bung of
one that inclined downward, and applied my mouth to the hole, drinking
a great quantity. I afterwards rinced the keg with the wine, which
contained about a gallon; and nearly filling it with wine, returned with
it slowly to the cask, pushing it before me. The gulls overhead, were
noisy and clamorous, and seemed to anticipate the meal they should make
of me. This keg I at last brought to the cask, to my great satisfaction;
set it outside, crawled in, and began to ruminate upon my condition. I
found it would be impossible, without succor, to move much longer about,
and determined to remain at home during the remainder of the day; and
if sufficient strength remained on the morrow, to rig a kind of signal,
with a pole or spar, as my only chance of relief, with a piece of
cotton bagging, for a flag, that if any vessel appeared near enough,
she might observe it from the river. I at first had serious thoughts of
endeavoring to get off the small boat, which I could discover at a great
distance, bottom up, and to rig a kind of sail, and steer up the river;
but on looking at my limbs, and having but one leg and arm serviceable, I
immediately abandoned the project; I knew too, that my time was short; I
knew that the next day I should be unable to make a farther search than
I had done for provisions, as the method of getting along was slow and
painful; I had frequently to stop and thrash myself, from the cold. Added
to this, nothing was more probable than that the first savage who should
discover me, would instantly despatch me, as an impediment to plunder.
I expected no less, and that my fears were not groundless, the sequel
too mournfully shows; but a certain presentiment of brighter hours,
still upheld my spirits, which were never less depressed than upon this
occasion. I remembered that the Great Director still had not forsaken me,
since ‘God is ever present, ever felt, in the wide waste as in the full
city,’ and I could not doubt that He whose outstretched arm had preserved
me through the conflict of that dreadful night, would not now leave me to
a miserable death. I was now more comfortably situated than at any former
period; I had a covering inside, and a keg of good wine outside. Every
thing considered, I determined to wait with humble hope, the will of
heaven; I was resigned and cheerful, and even sung, and was happy. After
this, by repeated drinking, owing to excessive thirst, I was thrown into
a doze of about half an hour.

It was now three days and nights since I had taken food, and my taper
of life began to glimmer in the socket. How I survived these scenes of
accumulated misery so long, when but barely alive on reaching the shore,
I scarcely can tell; the retrospect even now astonishes me. But frail
mortality could resist no longer; my strength had utterly failed, and at
this period I abandoned all hope of again leaving the pipe.

The day was declining apace, and I expected not to behold another dawn. I
hailed the approaching night as the termination of my toils; considered
the mean covering over me as my shroud, the cask as my coffin, and waited
with fortitude the hour of dissolution. But the next was the hour of
deliverance!

At four o’clock, on this afternoon, (Saturday, the 20th of September,)
as I was stretched out in the cask, indulging in recollections of home,
I was aroused from my reveries by the startling sound of a horse’s
feet. I waited his approach with calmness, being absolutely indifferent
in my choice, to sleep or die;—the sounds grew louder and nearer—in a
few moments a horse with a rider appeared before the cask. I hailed
in Spanish, faintly, “amigo,” (friend,)—he instantly alighted, but
struck with such a ghastly spectacle as I then exhibited, he started
as he stooped down to observe me, and recoiled backwards against his
horse. Recovering soon, however, from his dismay, by seeing my helpless
condition, he re-advanced to learn by what means I had outlived the
general wreck. He was a young man of benevolent features, a Creole, or
half Indian, and dressed partly in the Indian method. I told my tale in a
few words, to which he listened with breathless attention, and concluded
by asking him the distance to a habitation; and if it was possible that
he could furnish means for reaching one the next day, as I had no idea
but that he came from a great distance. ‘In a few hours,’ he replied;
‘before night, I can return with horses and assistance, as my mother’s
rancho, (or hut) is not more than one league distant.’ After a few more
questions, he expressed his surprise at my providential rescue, crossing
himself repeatedly at every ‘hair breadth escape,’ and blessed St.
George, as my special preserver. It was lucky, he said, that I spoke his
language so well; that I was very fortunate in being discovered by him,
whose mother, he said, lived at the nearest habitation, whither I should
be conveyed; assuring me if I had fallen into the hands of the savages,
they would certainly have despatched me, for they were merciless and
ferocious. But first says he, ‘I will bring you something to eat, for you
look half starved;’ so saying, he jumped upon his horse, and was soon
out of sight. His period of absence, seemed to me an age. A prospect of
deliverance, of once more beholding my country, had lighted up a hope
within me, and again I feared he might prove a deceiver.

In about an hour, however, he appeared, and the foam of his good horse
bore witness that he had lost no time. He jumped from his steed, and
threw into my lap, as I sat upright in the cask, a warm sausage, and
some mouldy bread, wrapped up in a napkin. I greedily seized the food,
thinking I could devour it at once; but was surprised to find I could not
swallow a mouthful, my throat being contracted, closed and sore.

He now informed me, that on his first coming down to the beach, he had
passed the pipe in which I was laying, without suspicion, at a distance
upon his left, as he rode near the water; that he saw the beach covered
for a great length with numberless articles of the wreck, and that he had
been greatly disconcerted on finding the sand dug away from around a roll
of cotton, and one carried off, and no marks of footsteps, or any thing
living, excepting the sea gulls—that he had seen but one corpse, and
that of one of the sailors; that a great many chests, trunks, &c. he had
likewise seen; some half buried in the sand; others broken open by the
sea; but many that were locked and entire, and that if I wished, he would
search for my own, if I would describe it, and draw it up before the
cask. I told him that my chests were unlocked at the time we struck, and
of course the contents were scattered and sunk. He however rode away to a
great distance, and drew up at repeated times, several chests and trunks,
belonging to the passengers and seamen, saying that there were many more,
but at such a distance, so buried, or so heavy, that he could not drag
them along. He asked me for several pieces of clothing, which he had
picked up. I told him to keep whatever he pleased, as none could dispute
his right to them. He then began to plan the means for my removal; I
thought it most practicable that he should empty one of the largest
chests of its contents, and that I should get inside, and his horse
should draw me over the plains. This he told me was impossible, from the
shrubs and marshes and pools, which obstructed the path. I left it then
wholly to his care, as my head was far too heavy to talk or to reason;
and from previous exertion, even fell back into the cask. My friend then
made his lasso (a line of green hide, with which they catch wild horses,)
fast to the handle of the largest trunk, and with an assurance that he
would soon return, drove off. I listened with painful feelings to the
sound of the horse’s retreating footsteps; for on him alone rested my
hope of deliverance.

Shortly after he had gone, a guacha, a savage of fierce and murderous
countenance, rode up and alighted from his horse in great haste, and
roughly asked, ‘quien es usted?’ I replied, ’un marinero naufrago;’ ‘es
usted el capitan?’ ‘no,’ I answered; ‘estoy el pilota,’ and that I had
previously been discovered by a paysano, who had just left me to return
with assistance. He demanded the road he took; I told him, when he leaned
upon his horse and galloped off in the direction the other had taken.

It seems, as my deliverer afterwards informed me, that this savage came
up with him and endeavored by entreaties and threats, to dissuade him
from his design of assisting me; saying I had better be despatched and
buried in the sand, and then there would be none to dispute the right of
plunder. But my deliverer told him that the chief was already acquainted
with the affair, as well as his father and others, who were even then
preparing to go down to the beach; on hearing this, he lost no time, but
turning his horse, hastily spurred off in an opposite course.

During the absence of my friend, my moments in the cask were spent in the
most tormenting anxiety and suspence. I had been discovered, contrary
to all conjecture, by a friend, instead of an enemy, and one bright ray
of hope, which I hardly dared to cherish, had reanimated my soul. Now
was the fearful hazard that he should not return with timely succor. I
eagerly listened to catch the sound of his returning galloping steed;
after a while I heard the approach of several horses; I awaited their
appearance with breathless hope, for my life or my death hung upon the
moment.

What was my dismay and surprise, at the next moment, on beholding the
remorseless face of the same fellow who last had left me! his infernal
companions also dismounted, and presented their diabolical visages at the
mouth of the cask. For a few moments their ensued a violent and clamorous
dispute between them, with horrid grimaces. Resistance was madness; my
feelings I will not attempt to describe. Suddenly I saw their faces
turned to one direction; they instantly sheathed their knives, and sprang
toward their horses and vanished.

In a moment, my friend, accompanied by his father and three slaves,
alighted from their horses. They immediately set about removing me gently
from the cask, while Pedro, (the name of my discoverer,) breaking open
a passenger’s trunk, that lay near, advised me to permit him to draw
over me some of the apparel; alleging, that in my present appearance, I
should be taken by the inhabitants for a common sailor; but if clothed
in a decent manner, I should gain among them more advantage, respect
and security. I, therefore, seated on the sand, suffered the painful
operation of dressing. A surtout and waistcoat was got over me, but my
leg being so greatly swelled, prevented my getting over it any thing but
a pair of loose drawers. I was then carefully lifted on the back of the
horse; my attentive friend Pedro leaped up before me; holding on to him,
I had strength sufficient to keep myself in an upright position.

I had just been seated on the back of the animal, when the general, who
commanded the troops in this quarter, appeared with a guard of soldiers,
and several others. He took me kindly by the hand, promised me his
protection, and taking a case bottle of Aguadente from one of the guard,
reached it to me; I drank nearly half a pint, and felt much enlivened. He
then took off his pancho, or cloak, and threw it over me; asking me if I
preferred going to the cottage of the party that had me in care, or to
his own quarters. I thanked him, and in reply told him, that these had
saved my life, and I could trust them freely, and desired not to leave
them. Go on then, said he, con Dios, and to-night I will visit you. We
then set forward at a slow pace, travelling along the windings of the
beach.

I saw the body of a seaman, but we rode not near enough for me to
distinguish his features; he layed upon his back, clothed in a red baize
shirt and trowsers. I looked around to see if there were others, but my
friend assured me there were none. The beach was strewed with the wreck
to a great length, lying in every kind of position and in confused masses.

The bright rays of the setting sun, now for a few moments enlivened our
path, as we left the beach and turned off into the country, across the
plains. A negro preceded us on horseback, to sound the way, as the land
was wet and marshy. The raging waves had now subsided to an unruffled
calm, and I cast my eyes mournfully towards that treacherous sea, which
now looked so peaceful and flattering.

We arrived at last, about dusk, to a small cottage; having travelled as
I computed nearly a league. A number of large dogs gave notice of our
approach, but were soon silenced by my companions, who assisted me gently
to dismount. I was welcomed with many blessings by an old woman; carried
into her hut, seated in a chair, some clothing was brought forward, and
I soon felt the comfort of a dry shirt. ‘I have no beef or mutton in the
house,’ says the old woman, for the army take all our beasts; but we have
some fowls, which may do as well. I was soon put in the only bed in the
hut, to me a bed of down; and my kind hostess soon brought me a bowl of
good broth. After this, my leg was washed with hot vinegar, and my wounds
on my feet dressed as well as circumstances would permit.

This rancho, or hut, was a small place built like all others, of cane,
fastened together with strips of green hide, plaistered with mud, and
a thatch’d roof. The general came about dark, spent an half hour, and
retired. I considered myself as peculiarly fortunate on being now under
the care of an old woman, the indispensable attendant in sickness, and
alleviator of calamity; developing those endearing and estimable traits
of character, usefulness, patience and compassion. My leg was again
bathed in hot vinegar, and bandages of woollen applied; and my hostess
left me and retired to her repose. During the night I drank a great
quantity both of wine and water, which had been set within reach, for
my thirst was unquenchable. Two junk bottles of hot water were covered
and placed in bed against my feet; which were much swelled, chilled,
and wrinkled, and almost without feeling. This sudden application of
artificial heat to the blood, though well intended, had a most pernicious
effect; corrupting, stagnating, and destroying its natural temperature,
and causing great pain; its effects were felt many months afterwards.
During the night I slept but little. The rays of the sun breaking into
the room, announced the morning of the Sabbath, and I could in truth hail
it as a welcome and sweet day of rest.

I now took a view of the apartment and furniture; the room was partly
separated by a partition of cane poles, inside of which slept my hostess
and her two younger sons, upon the floor; as there was but one bedstead,
upon which I lay. Her eldest son, my discoverer, lay near me, wrapped up
in his pancho, or blanket; the old man, his father, lived in another hut,
at a relations, for fear of the guaches, as he was a Spaniard.

At the further end of the hovel was kept constantly burning upon a table,
on each side of a crucifix, two candles; which is the invariable custom
when any one lies dangerously sick. A separate hut for the kitchen, was
built outside. The furniture consisted of a few hide bottomed chairs,
some hide sacks and baskets, a hide sieve, and several other necessary
articles, of which hide was the principal material. During the day, I
inquired of the old woman of the state of affairs about the country, and
at Monte Video. She told me that the Portuguese were kept close within
its walls by the natives; and that any communication between the city and
country was very precarious and difficult, as a great animosity subsisted
between them. Pedro at this time had mounted his cavallo, and taken an
excursion to the beach; towards night he entered the hut, bringing in a
hide sack of flour from the wreck, which he had drawn away by the aid of
his horse; and soon after, brought in several other articles, such as
bottles of wine and cordial, a keg of butter; some rum, and a keg of wine
from a cask—these he stowed away in the interior of the hut, and then
took his seat at my bedside as usual.

In conversation, he expressed to me his fears of the intemperate and
remorseless guachas, whom he said, valued the life of a person no more
than that of a dog; that they were unsettled, roving, and lived upon
plunder. To beguile the evenings of my tedious confinement, he would also
relate to me the products of the country, its animals, &c.; a choice
horse might be bought for a dollar, though a bad saddle would cost
twenty. Ostriches were plenty in the neighborhood, valuable only for
their eggs and feathers, of which they made fans and dusters. The nature
of this bird, he said, was very singular, and he had often watched at a
distance their method of depositing their eggs; the bird, after assuring
herself of being unnoticed, would scratch a hole in the sand, deposite
her egg, and carefully covering the place, retreat slyly to the thicket,
and leave to the sun the care of hatching them.

The next day, the general came again, bringing with him several bottles
of wine and cordial, which he had taken from the wreck.

A country fellow came in soon after, an acquaintance of my hostess;
and she offered him a draught of the cordial. I shall never forget the
inexpressible contortions of countenance, the heartfelt smack, the
exclamation of wonder and relish with which he swallowed his glass of
liquor, of the taste of which, he had before no conception.

I desired the general to inform me if it was possible to send a letter
to Monte Video. He told me it was difficult, as there was but little
intercourse; but that he knew of a patriot officer, who, having a
passport, would go in a few days to the city. I therefore, the day
following, procured of the old woman, materials for writing, and a
chopping block. This I placed between my legs on the bed, and began
writing; it was a tedious business, and I could sit up no longer than to
write one line at a time. I however finished this necessary duty, and
wrote two letters; one directed to W. P. White, Esq., the only person
I was acquainted with at Monte Video, whom I had formerly known in the
capital; and another to the owners in Buenos Ayres. I briefly related
the loss of the ship, the fate of the crew, my own situation; and
advising something to be done to save the property; of which a greater
part had been washed ashore. These I gave to the girl, who in two days
forwarded them to the capital.

Pedro, during this day, was still employed, assisted by the two slaves,
in recovering articles and provisions, from the beach; which he said was
now covered with the natives, who were breaking open trunks, chests, and
bales of goods; staving in the pipes of wine, when any one wanted to
drink; and exhibiting a confused scene of plunder, fighting, and wanton
waste of goods; of which they knew not the value.

Getting drunk with the wine, on the beach, they frequently came to the
cottage, and with brutal language and savage gestures, threatened the
lives of its generous inhabitants.

As his mother was once bringing in some cakes for me from the kitchen,
the ruffians snatched them from her hand; then entering the kitchen,
seized and devoured what victuals were there, and threw away the plates.

She one day entered with tears in her eyes, and told me she was sadly
afraid of her life and my own, from the Indians; they were very bad
men;—and she had overheard a parley between them, of breaking into the
hut during the night, to plunder and murder. Indeed, their looks alone
spoke their savage character; for often, at times, laying on my bed, I
have observed them attentively, as they would sometimes venture into the
hut; and I never saw such rascally and ugly looking fellows. They were
generally of large size, long black hair, hanging like snakes down their
shoulders; thick bushy beard and mustachios; a coarse blanket or pancho
wrapped round their waist; another with a hole in the middle, through
which they thrust their heads; a turban or checked handkerchief on their
heads; horse skin boots, stripped raw from the animal’s leg, and worn raw
into the shape of the feet. These, with a sword nearly a fathom long, in
an iron scabbard, gave them a most hideous appearance; they indeed looked
like demons. All wore long knives stuck into a sheath, in the blanket
behind, which they made use of for every purpose; to kill, cut up beef,
eat with, and stab their fellow creatures.

The friendly general again came in the evening, attended by several
soldiers; and at his departure, left a guard of three at our earnest
request, who were well armed, for our defence. This military officer,
whose name was Ortugues, appeared much like one of our own country
farmers, excepting his formidable iron scabbard sword. His dress was a
short jacket of coarse blue, over which was thrown his pancho, or square
cloak, drab velvet breeches, and long boots; he seemed a well meaning and
benevolent man; but no ways capable of commanding a horde of vagabond
marauders, whom he was organising into an army, for the defence of the
country, against the encroachments of the Portuguese.

The cause of the Indians’ animosity and attempts to attack and plunder,
was, that they suspected as Pedro was the first who had discovered the
wreck on the beach, he had the first chance of booty, and of course had
obtained a great quantity of gold, silver, and other valuable property;
and had secreted them in the cottage. Impressed with this notion, which I
believe was false and groundless, they made several nightly attempts to
force the door, but were repulsed by the guard.

I passed these days very unquietly at the cottage, and time seemed to
roll most tediously slow. The old lady had some cigars and old books, and
I endeavored, by smoking and reading, to beguile the hours. The books,
though some were an hundred and fifty years old, were not uninteresting.
They consisted partly of the ‘Lives of the Martyrs;’ ‘Sermons by a Priest
at Madrid;’ and a large volume of the ‘History of the Conquest of Peru.’

In the evening, Pedro would take his seat at the bedside, and amuse and
interest me by his conversation. On an occasion like this, he said, he
would relate the following tale, which before he had no opportunity
to do. It shows that my discovery and rescue were wholly owing to a
circumstance purely fortuitous and accidental.

‘Early in the morning of Thursday,’ said he, ‘two days before you were
found on the strand, a soldier of the army of Artigas was strolling on
horseback nearer the beach than they usually travel. At about a mile
from the scene of the wreck, he discerned in a small cove at the river
side, something on the beach; and as it was uncommon to observe any
object breaking the uniformity of the sandy plain, he resolved to ride
down and examine it. It proved to be one of the kegs of butter, nearly
the size of a half barrel, which had been separated by the sea from the
other drifting articles, and washed and lodged into this little bay. The
soldier alighted from his horse, turned it over, but could not tell what
it contained. It being heavy, and thinking it of little value, he left it
and rode away. Some time after, in his return, he came near our cottage;
he had before frequently stopped here; and now resolved to go in. In the
course of conversation with me, on different affairs, he mentioned the
discovery, at the river side, of a small barrel, very heavy; containing
he knew not what, and supposed it to have drifted ashore from some
vessel. Soon after, he left the cottage, and proceeded on his journey.
That day and the next, being very stormy, cold and rainy, prevented me
from going abroad. On Saturday the weather was still unfair, but at noon
it began to clear away. I mounted my cavallo in the afternoon, and took a
ride in the direction described by the soldier, in search of the keg he
had spoken of. This I soon saw at the edge of the water, and supposing
that this was not all that had been driven ashore by the storm, I was
induced to make a further search; and recollecting that the wind had been
for several days blowing obliquely up the river, I concluded to shape my
course down the sea side for new discoveries. Accordingly, I rode on a
great distance, without seeing any thing else, and was on the point of
returning; when, on winding round a small point of land, I plainly saw at
a short distance a thousand vestiges of the wreck covering the beach. I
rode slowly through them, near the edge of the water, stopping at times
to view them, but not dismounting. I passed the cask you lay in, which I
saw was thrown very high up the beach. ‘It was rather strange,’ said he,
‘that you did not hear my horse’s steps.’ I told him I did not; for the
tread on the sand was not loud, and the roar of the sea might serve to
prevent it. ‘I traversed the whole length of the beach, and frequently
stopped to examine different objects of the wreck. I had probably been
half an hour on the beach, before I had a thought of one alive so near
me.’ I told him I was, during the period of his survey, lying quietly
in the cask, without a hope of again leaving it, and wholly unconscious
deliverance was so near. ‘In returning,’ he continued, ‘I was passing
close to the sand hill between the banks and your place of shelter, and
should have passed the cask, if I had not heard a hollow voice from
within.’ I inquired if the roll of bagging across the pipe’s mouth, did
not attract his notice. ‘No, my friend pilota,’ said Pedro, ‘I should
certainly have rode on without regarding it; for I had seen a hundred
things just before, in equally curious positions. Your voice alone, which
started me at first, caused me to dismount, and look into the cask; and
my God, I shall never forget the sight as long as I live.’ What a scene
was this for the pencil of the painter!

On the eve of about the fourth day, I asked Pedro, if any of the bodies
had washed ashore, besides the one we saw. He replied, not one; and
wondered how that alone should be cast so far on shore.

I told him I presumed it was one of the stoutest of the seamen, who had
fortunately cleared himself from the ship, without much damage, and had
resolutely continued ‘breasting the lofty surge,’ till he reached the
middle of the breakers; when, being there overpowered, he expired and
sunk; and the force of the waves then propelled the body to the shore
before it descended to the bottom.

It is surprising that human bodies will, when dead, sink and continue
at the bottom, unmoveable; while other substances, of much greater
proportionate weight, will be thrown on shore by the sea.

My friend brought in, and shew me, at different times, large detached
pieces of iron, and ring bolts, &c. which he found half buried in the
sand.

I was now slowly gaining strength; but each returning day brought fresh
alarm from the murderous designs of the villain guachas. On the fourth
night they went to the next hut upon the beach, about four miles off,
where dwelt a poor and harmless family, and robbed it of every thing
valuable, or worth taking; mortally stabbed the father; bound his
daughters, and brutally abused them. One of them, an interesting white
girl, came the next day to our hut, for some relief, and told in tears
the dreadful story.

I had about this time, a great many visiters, who all considered me
highly favored by my patron saint, to whom they attributed my hair breath
escapes. Among them, were many old women, who came from a distance, and
travelled on horseback, about the country, bartering their commodities.

A consultation was once held by them, respecting my fever, leg, and
bruises; and they recommended a large leaf of an herb, which grows in
that country; which, dipped in hot oil and vinegar, had a wonderful
and salutary effect when applied to my limb; although the application
caused a most uneasy sensation, combined with suffocating pain during two
nights; the swelling greatly subsided, excepting about the bend of the
knee. During this, for five days, I could lie in only one position in
bed, and that on my right side; my wounded leg lying on pillows; the knee
bent about half way; in which unvaried bend, it remained in fact, more
than a month.

I could instantly perceive a change of wind, on the least motion; and
once on moving, when the wind had shifted to the north, the effect was
so electric as to cause me to scream aloud. And when, at last, I was
compelled to relieve for a moment my painful and palsying posture, it was
the task of half an hour to turn myself in bed.

My appetite, at this time, had become insatiate, and though I could not
get so much to eat as I wanted, owing to the care of my old nurse, I
ate great quantities, and drank all that came within my reach; keeping
bottles of liquor under my pillow, for my night supply. The smallest
lad’s chief occupation was to bring in water; of which, during the twelve
days I remained here, I believe I drank fifty gallons, besides half a
dozen bottles of cordial, a dozen of wine, ten gallons of port, in a keg,
and several bottles of other liquors; all of which Pedro had saved from
the beach.

My condition appeared to engross all the attention of my kind hostess,
and occupy all her care and time. She never entered the apartment, nor
went to sleep, without the kind question of ‘que quero usted, pilota?’
(what is wanting;) and the answer was usually, ‘water.’

I asked her one afternoon what reward she expected, or what recompense
I should give; or what return I could make, for her untiring goodness.
‘Speak not of it, Don Horky,’ said she; ‘who can tell but that my son
Pepe, may go to other countries by sea, and be shipwrecked, and cast
ashore, and that your mother may then do that and more, for him, than I
am doing now for you.’ It was an answer heartfelt, I believe, by us both,
though I smiled to think on the improbability that Pedro could be thrown
ashore in a storm, upon a wharf in Boston.

This family had lived many years happily and comfortably in Monte Video,
previous to its surrender to the Patriots, in 1813; but were then
compelled to quit their home; and since that period, had suffered, as
well as many other families, all the hardships to which their adhesion
to the cause of old Spain, exposed them. The old man, her husband, was
in constant fear of his life; and during my stay at the hut, which drew
many unwelcome visiters, appeared only once or twice, and then only in
the evening; living otherwise, as before mentioned, at a relation’s,
concealed.

On the second evening, he came and inquired of his wife about me, as
follows: ‘Bien,’ says he, ‘como esta su huespedo?’ ‘mucho mejor,’ she
replied; ‘tiene gano muy vivo para beber y comer;’ ‘esta christiano?’
he asked, which made me smile. ‘Sin duda,’ she replied; ‘todas son
christianos en Norte America;’ ‘como los Inglesas y el pilota sabe las
nombres de todas los santas, y puede repeto el credo catolico.’ ‘Dios le
guarda,’ he replied; and to me, ‘a Dios, usted le passa bein;’ so saying,
he left the cottage.

On inquiring my health, and asking if I was a christian, she answered,
‘much better;’ and doubtless a christian, as all in America, as well
as the English, were christians; and that as evidence, I could repeat
the Catholic creed, and knew the names of all the saints; for which he
bestows his benediction.

When at times I would whistle and sing, to beguile the pain, my hostess
would ask the reason. I told her I did so to kill the pain. But I saw
she often thought from my strange behaviour, that my fever and pain had
rendered me delirious. My apprehensions, however, in this weak state,
and nervous debility of body and mind, gave me incessant and tormenting
anxiety.

The close of each day gave rise to painful fears, for the events of the
dreaded night; expecting constantly the breaking in of the guachas; and
knowing too well their merciless ferocity. The nightly barking of the
watchful dogs, giving notice of their approach, sounded in my ears like a
summons bell, tolling for execution. I was not certain of living out an
hour, nor was my chance of life of the value of a shilling.

One night, when all had retired to rest, and the guards lay snoring upon
the floor, the dogs set up a roaring yell, and we soon after heard the
tread of heavy footsteps, and violent thumping at the door. Pedro, who
lay at my side, aroused the guards and opened it; while the soldiers and
my hostess prepared for defence.

I saw by the moonshine, five hideous looking fellows, armed with swords
and bayonets, standing before the door. A sharp parley ensued between
them and the guard. They said that they had orders to search the hut for
any money or valuables, that the pilota, (myself,) might have recovered
from the wreck. But the guard presenting their pieces, told them it was
all false, and a contrivance to plunder; as they themselves were placed
there by the General for my defence, and they would directly fire upon
them, unless they instantly made off.

At this, they thought proper to make a speedy retreat, stealing in their
way a horse from the field.

I was now in anxious and daily expectation of some persons from Monte
Video, to convey me from this fearful situation and dangerous abode. On
the eighth day, I was agreeably relieved, by the arrival of two clerks,
an Englishman and Spaniard, from Monte Video, in consequence of receiving
my letters, from the house of the consignees, in order to effect my
removal to the city, and also to endeavor to secure some part of the
property.

The latter they found totally impossible, nothing of value being now left
on the strand, as all had been carried up country, by the natives.

I was extremely rejoiced at their coming, and we were soon concerting
plans for my departure. Lines and posts of defence had been established
between Toledo, the place where I was, and Monte Video, and these
prevented any cattle or provisions being carried from the country to the
Portuguese, in the city, whom they considered as invaders.

Oxen, therefore, not being allowed to pass into the city, mules not here
to be procured, it was at last agreed that they should return to Monte
Video, and send down a cart with mules, from the city. They slept one
night at the hut, and on the next day, Sunday, departed; having seen
sufficient of the character of the natives, and glad they had escaped
the knives of the guachas, and vowing they would not venture their lives
again among such a murderous crew, for the value of a ship and cargo.

On the eve of the next day, Monday, Pedro brought in the trunk which he
had drawn from the beach at my desire, at the time of my discovery, and
now opened it to examine what articles it might contain. He told me he
had hitherto kept it secreted in the grass, in the rear of the cot; and
had not dared to take out any articles to dry for fear of the deserters
and Indians; for should they discover any thing valuable hanging out,
they would certainly steal it, and search the house for more. But none of
them being now near the house, he had brought it in to the side of the
bed, for my inspection.

It was a large black English iron-bound trunk, of the largest size,
containing every article of clothing, but no money. These were all
thoroughly wet, and many indelibly spotted and mildewed, the effects
of the salt water. This stock of apparel was at this time a great
acquisition to me, as my whole wardrobe consisted of a borrowed shirt.[2]

Among the things he handed me, were a set of long muslin curtains for a
state room; which the old lady begged I would give to her. And Pedro in
his turn, thought that a couple pair of the pantaloons would make him
happy as a cavallero; to which I readily assented, and told them I laid
claim to nothing but their hospitality, for which I was a constant debtor.

At the bottom was found a large roll of papers, which he handed me, and
carefully unrolling them, I expected they were a set of interesting
manuscripts; but found them to be only a collection of beautiful colored
French engravings; such as the four seasons, twelves months, subjects
from scripture, Robinson Crusoe, &c.; in all about forty; which I
requested Pedro to hang on a line overhead to dry, which he did. Most of
the contents were then stowed again in the trunk, and Pedro dragged it
back to its place of concealment.

The next morning I awoke with earnest expectation of the cart from Monte
Video; but I waited in vain; and evening brought fresh cause of fear.

During this day, an Irishman, a laborer, who had lived many years in that
country, came; and after some conversation with my hostess, requested of
her the loan of a spade.

He said he had but just come from the beach, and that several bodies
of my companions lay exposed on the sand, and that the gulls were
devouring them; that the Indians were too intent on plunder, and getting
intoxicated, to assist in interring them; and that he would again go down
to perform this christian office, and bury them in the sand.

An old kind of shovel was mustered for him, and he went off with this
laudable design. Returning the next day, he informed me he had buried
several, and many bodies had come ashore in a shocking state; so broken
and bruised that it was impossible to distinguish them; some, he said,
were still in the surf, which he could not drag out; and of necessity,
had to leave, ‘food for gulls;’ their bones, doubtless, at this day, lie
bleaching on the sand.

I was still waiting with the most painful anxiety, for the arrival of the
conveyance from the city; and no poor and condemned malefactor, in hopes
of a reprieve, or pardon, ever waited with more emotion the mandate which
should restore him his liberty, than I did for a passport and conveyance
to the walls of Monte Video.

The cannibals were daily and hourly growing more barbarous; and our
danger every moment increased. I had every reason to believe that on this
night, they intended to make a desperate attack upon the cottage, and to
have murdered all in their power. But Providence otherwise ordered.

About sunset, the little lad came running into the hut, from his play,
exclaiming to his mother, that ‘a strange thing was coming towards the
house.’ My heart throbbed a little at this notice, and soon after, as I
hoped for, I was gratified with the entrance of the driver and guide, of
the long wished for cart. They were cordially welcomed; and as they slept
in the hut, I passed the night with a more temperate feeling, and a mind
less apprehensive of a midnight attack.

To death, and to danger the most terrific, I had been exposed, and had
faced them with manly firmness. I had escaped from wild beasts, and met
the fury of elements, without shrinking; but the horrid prospect of
having my flesh gashed and lacerated, by the knives of the savages, gave
me infinite anguish; and heated with fever, rage and indignation, I could
almost, at times, had it been in my power, have seized indiscriminate
destruction, and like Samson of old, have sacrificed my own life to
relieve it from such a state of torturing suspence, and to take revenge
upon the blood thirsty ruffians; for here were men, if I may so degrade
the term, (for they were not indeed in the image of their Maker,) ‘more
fierce and more inexorable far, than empty tigers, or the roaring sea.’

The twelfth day came, and we were to depart. I hailed it with pleasure,
as a day of second deliverance. The guide and the driver were employed
in the morning, in lining the side of the cart with rushes, to keep off
the wind; they had brought down with them a bed, with coverings and
blankets. The trunk was brought and laid across the fore part of the
cart, by Pedro; while his mother was busy in wrapping me up within, for
the journey. A great number of blankets and coverings, were also thrown
over me. My feet were bound up in woollen, and a flag handkerchief was
tied round my head; I had on, likewise, a large coat, loose pantaloons,
and flannel underdress. A chair was placed at the hinder part of the
cart, which now backed to the door of the cottage, from which I was
lifted inside and placed upon the blankets at the bottom.

At parting I shook the hands of the kind old woman, and my deliverer,
most heartily. A crowd of grateful recollections stifled for a moment my
expressions of gratitude, and started the tears of overpowered feelings.
I left them with fervent benedictions, and we drove off slowly on our way.

During our progress, I had leisure to contemplate my hopes and prospects;
and my mind wanted no food or exercise in considering this odd journey,
and in so odd a company.

The sun beamed forth gloriously, and the day appeared delightful; and
though I could not yet hear the busy hum of men, yet the cheering music
of the feathered warblers, the sight of the vast plains on one side, and
the boundless expanse of the great La Plata on the other; the novelty of
my situation, the memory of past dangers, the many aids of Providence,
whose unseen hand had protected me thus far, and the hopes of future
comforts yet in store, led my thoughts to adore that great and benevolent
Being, without whose notice, not even a sparrow falls to the ground.

Nothing remarkable, excepting one unlucky accident, happened on the road,
which was the loss of the engravings. The guide, who was an ill looking
and suspicious fellow, who lived in the vicinity, had collected them
from the lines in the hut, and put them under the bed at the tail of the
cart. When about half way on our journey, he suddenly dropped astern, and
saying he could go on no farther, pulling out the prints, thrust them
into his bosom, galloped off and vanished.

We were interrogated at the lines by some officers, who came out of a
decent house by the roadside, as we were now near the city, who asked
many questions, and allowed us freely to proceed; in a short time we
gained sight of the gates of Monte Video; at which we at last arrived
about 2 o’clock, P. M. Here I was also stopped by a number of Portuguese
officers, who were tall and well looking men, who asked also many
questions, having previously heard of the shipwreck; they expressed
themselves glad to see me, and we drove into the city.

The streets were not paved, but contained many large loose stones; and
the jolting of the cart over them, which now went at a smart trot, gave
me a severe shaking. The novelty of the sight drew many of the females to
the windows; and I beheld many wondering and fair faces, as I lay on my
back in the cart, exposed to the view of those above me.

We stopped at the house of an English merchant, the consignee, who
immediately came out, and with many friendly congratulations, personally
assisted his slaves in carrying me up stairs; passing along on the flat
roof of the lower story, round the court yard, in the centre, to a small
handsome chamber in the rear, which had been previously fitted up for the
use of one of our passengers. His family consisted of his wife, likewise
English, and an interesting and beautiful child, of about three years
old. His lady, (whom Heaven bless,) was constant in her acts of kindness.
I found I could not support myself in a chair, for this was the first
time, since the disaster, that I had made the attempt, and was therefore
helped to undress, and assisted to bed. This night I slept for the first
time soundly; for I had reached the desired place of security, and my
dreams were not disturbed by the clamor of the guachas.

The next day, my trunk was opened, and the clothes washed and put up in
the neatest order. Two whole pieces of black bombazette, and several
dozen of white cotton hose and socks, were likewise found in it; which
were sold, and brought me about thirty dollars.

Here I was confined for nearly thirty days, and my leg shrunk in that
time to as great an extreme as it was swelled before. By unexampled
kindness, I daily and rapidly improved; and in three weeks was able to
leave the room, and sit outside of the chamber, upon the walk.

One of the owners of the ship happening at this time to be in Monte
Video, instantly came to visit me, and hear the account of the loss
of his ship. When I had repeated the occurrences, and related the
hospitality of the old woman at the cottage, he immediately proposed a
subscription among the merchants for her recompense, generously and nobly
disregarding his own loss, though he was owner of half of the ship, and
uninsured. There came also next day, notaries to take my deposition on
oath, respecting the cause of the ship’s being thrown ashore. It was
accordingly set down as occasioned by the violence of the storm.

I was often solicited by my kind friends, to have medical assistance; but
this I constantly refused. I had never occasion for a physician, having,
doubtless unreasonably, a prejudice against them; nature therefore took
her course, and my leg, though once threatened with amputation, grew
daily stronger, to the surprise of all who first witnessed my situation,
and slowly resumed its natural shape; and in six weeks, I was able to
take the salutary exercise of a walk, with a cane; to ride a short
distance upon a gentle horse, and shortly after, eat at their table.

Gratitude must here be allowed a digression, to give vent to her
feelings, and to prevent her devoirs at the shrine of benevolence. While
under this hospitable roof, all that could contribute to alleviate
pain; everything that could add to my convenience and comfort; kindness,
which anticipated my wishes, I enjoyed in its fullest extent. Though a
distressed foreigner, I was treated as a brother; and though a stranger,
ever welcome to their board. For three weeks, while on the bed of
friendship, I was visited at the first dawn of the morning by the worthy
merchant, who with his own hands would dress my wounds, thus emulating
the example of the good Samaritan.

His name, JOHN L. DARBY, Esq. I with pleasure record. A name well known
to the mercantile community, at Monte Video; and while life continues,
will with me be held dear.

It would be well, if I could here conclude, and the hapless tale could
now be ended. But as a faithful narrator, I am constrained to give its
melancholy sequel.

After I had been in Monte Video about six weeks, I received the shocking
intelligence, that on the night of the same day on which I left the
cottage, the merciless savages attacked and entered the hut of the old
woman, and finding no opposition, as the guards had withdrawn to the
encampment, plundered the hut of all she possessed, wounded the slaves
who opposed them, and after repeatedly stabbing my worthy deliverer,
finished with cutting his throat from ear to ear! How just are the words
of the poet,

    ‘The ways of heaven are dark, and intricate;
    Man, puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errors,
    Sees not with how much art the windings turn,
    Nor when the regular confusion ends.’

I was now rapidly gaining strength; my leg I could bear my weight on; and
after remaining here two months, I was strong enough to take passage for
Buenos Ayres, distant about a hundred and ten miles, farther up, and on
the opposite side of the river.

I arrived the next day, and found a great number of old acquaintance, who
were very kind and friendly. A subscription paper was immediately handed
round among the English merchants, by the goodness of the owners, Messrs.
MCFARLANE and EASTMAN, to whose friendship I must ever remain indebted,
and several hundred subscribed in an hour, and collected for my benefit.
About two hundred were also collected for the benefit of the old woman at
the hut, and two hundred more previously in Monte Video, and sent down to
her.

I remained some months on account of lameness in Buenos Ayres, and
applied for a passage in the Congress, Captain Sinclair, which was at
that time ready to return home with the three commissioners which she
conveyed out; but failing in this, I soon after had an application to the
birth of first officer of a large ship; the Manhattan, of 700 tons, sent
from the United States to be sold. Not succeeding in the sale, I entered
on board an Enserada, and we proceeded to fit her for her return home in
ballast.

On the 11th of July, 1818, we left the La Plata, and in forty days had
sight of Bermudas. On the 12th of September, we anchored off Fort Henry,
at Baltimore. I was detained here much against my will, twenty days,
in settling the ship’s accounts, taking an inventory, &c. and she was
publicly sold.

On Sunday morning, October 4th, I arrived at my native place, Boston,
after an absence of over two years; when I fully experienced the truth
of the observation, that the unavoidable evils and misfortunes of life,
afford by their contrast, a ten fold relish to its comforts, which are
many, but which before were unprised.

The meeting of relatives must be conceived. I will only add, that safe
in the embrace of parents and friends, forgotten like a dream, WERE THE
PERILS OF THE OCEAN.




APPENDIX.


THE SEA ... A SONG.

                       FIRST VOICE.

    How frightful the sea!—how appalling and wild!—
    With the howl of the tempest, the roaring waves pil’d,
        And the black clouds contending together!

                      SECOND VOICE.

    How fair is the sea!—and its quiet how deep;
    The zephyrs breathe calmly—how soft is its sleep;
        How sweet and inspiring the weather!

                       FIRST VOICE.

    Here thunders the storm-king, in terror and gloom,
    And soon yonder bark shall encounter her doom—
        Dash’d, a wreck, and be heard of no more!

                      SECOND VOICE.

    The goddess Eolia here trips o’er the sea,
    And yon gallant vessel, so bounding and free,
        Shall, in safety, again greet the shore.

                       FIRST VOICE.

    The demons of night flap their wings o’er the wave;
    ’Tis the shark’s dread abode—’tis the sea-monster’s cave—
        And perils unnumber’d abound!

                      SECOND VOICE.

    The rainbow at eve glads the mariner’s eye,
    And all the rich hues of a tropical sky,
        Emblazon the horizon round.

                       FIRST VOICE.

    The same sky above, and the same sea below—
    Dark or bright, rough or smooth, all the change he can know;
        For the sight of the land he’s in sorrow.

                      SECOND VOICE.

    No duns here molest, and no creditors sue;
    His bills are all paid, and his cares are but few,
        And he smiles at the wants of tomorrow.

                       FIRST VOICE.

    In his blest dreams of home, he’s arous’d from his sleep,
    From fireside joys, to the roar of the deep;
        And ‘Aloft! meet the storm,’ is the cry.

                      SECOND VOICE.

    To the roar of the tempest he carelessly sings;
    No fears to disturb, in his hammock he swings,
        And visions of home hover nigh!

                       FIRST VOICE.

    See the lover and friend, and the mother in tears!
    Dread sea, thou hast ruin’d the promise of years,
        And thy cruelty long they deplore.

                      SECOND VOICE.

    Hark! the archangel’s trump shall one day thro’ the deep,
    Wake to life and to light, the long lost ones that sleep,
        And old ocean her dead shall restore!


RIO JENEIRO.

Rio Jeneiro, in English, the River January—probably so called from the
month in which it was discovered—embraces the varied prospect of a bay
incomparable in scenery, a smooth harbor, variegated with many pleasant
little islands, which secure and embellish it; the shores on every side
teeming in luxuriant vegetation, and where nature, dressed always in the
robe of spring—gay as in her prime—sports in all her youthful vigor and
beauty. On first beholding this coast, the mind of a stranger is struck
with wonder and pleasure—he beholds mountains piled on mountains, of
every shape and posture—some bending their enormous heads, as if to awe
the lesser hills below, or rising in majestic pomp far above the highest
range of clouds, which float and curl, like misty veils, around them. The
city, St. Sebastian, is surrounded with a range of these high mountains,
which rise at a short distance in the interior, and enclose it as in a
semicircle. This barrier prevents the circulation of the pure mountain
breezes, and occasions a pale and sickly appearance in the sallow
complexions of the inhabitants; the streets, too, which appear like lanes
to an European, are narrow, and the houses lofty, which gives them, at
first, a wild and gloomy appearance. The buildings are mostly of brick
or stone, and plastered; but the eye of the pedestrian is soon diverted
from them, and arrested by the endless change in the faces, dresses and
complexions of the passing swarms that press about him, and throng this
populous, transatlantic city.

Here may be seen at one view, the well-fed priest pushing his fat body
along, and the half starved slave who touches his cap to him, though he
is sweating under the weight of a puncheon, which he assists in bearing
along. The bold free negro, with his cocked hat, and the stiff, proud
courtier, with his ribbands and stars; the thievish soldier off duty,
watching a group of sailors over their pot of wine, at the chop house;
and the strapping female slave, who cries ‘aick!’ and sells water, the
weight of which, in the balanced vessel on her head, would crack any
skull of less solidity than her own; the naval captain in his full dress,
brushing by a noisy pack of young black children, with no dress at all;
the begging friar from the convent, who fills his wallet with provisions,
and never knew a different mode of living; the statesman in black, who
kisses on his knees at the palace door, the one hand of the prince, while
he is eating an apple, a favorite fruit, with the other; the royal guard
of grenadiers, whose antique lengthy coats, make them appear like men of
other days; the droves of blacks, whose skeleton shapes bespeak them
wretches just released from yonder slave ship—these may be seen at once.

But where, oh, where, is lovely woman? To the face of whom, from the face
of naught for tedious months, but boisterous waves and frowning clouds,
the seamen with most pleasure turns. But here he turns in vain, for none
are seen. The sounds too, which stun him, are as varied as the objects
around. The ceaseless clang of a hundred bells, ringing too, rapid as for
life and death; the song and chorus of the laboring slaves, at the quay;
guns firing, rockets mounting, drums beating, chains clanking, and rocks
blowing, would lead a stranger to suppose that they made all this clamor
to drive away ennui, and disperse evil spirits.

The queen’s garden, at the extremity of the city, appears to merit most
attention. It is very spacious, and is bounded on one side by the bay,
against the wall of which the surf beats and roars, in great contrast
with the scenery within. The walks are very neat, and some charmingly
shaded from the sun, cool and solitary. But it is in the country only,
outside the town, that the naturalist and admirer of untrammelled nature,
may enjoy her richest banquet, for here she spreads her boards with
boundless variety. The air, though at first rather too warm, is generally
refreshed by the pure breeze of the mountains, and every thing appears
bright and beautiful; the mind in the delightful region, unwittingly
glows in unison with the cheerful prospect, and insensibly imbibes the
serenity and the grandeur of the surrounding landscapes.

On a Sunday afternoon, I took an excursion up the bay; on landing, I
pursued the course of the beach, and was charmed with the stillness and
the cheerfulness of the scenery around me. Here the sweet scented lemon
tree, the orange, and the lime, extending even to the touch of the wave,
afforded a delightful retreat from the blaze of a tropical sun.

The beautiful and nimble lizards, which I had thought repulsive reptiles,
were playing about among the stones of the beach. The velocity of
their motions, their sudden change of attitude, and their elegant and
symmetrical forms—with their little green eyes, pointed noses, taper
tails and spotted bodies, afforded a deal of amusement. We then bent our
way into the interior. Here we travelled along at the foot of an immense
hill, whose sloping sides were covered, as far as the eye could reach,
with thick woods of oranges and other tropical fruits.

In a little time we fell in with a party of merry making blacks, of both
sexes, who were indulging, in all its glory, the jubilee of a Fandango.
This is a sort of African dance of the negroes, of which they are
excessively fond; it is performed by numerous evolutions, in which they
sometimes join hands and form a circle, in the centre of which, are the
indefatigable and sweating musicians, who, with their huge calabashes,
kettle drums and reed pipes, labor to make all the noise—if not the
most musical—they possibly can. The dancers, more especially the women,
are most fantastically arrayed, having on the head a cap or turban,
ornamented with beads, ribbons and small looking glasses; a short, gay
dress, a string of beads—negro fine—around their necks, and the wrists
and ankles encircled by a string of castanos, a nut shell, the rattle of
which, in the dance, keeps time to the music. No one can behold, with
unruffled face, or with any degree of gravity, the negro Fandango. The
ridiculous dresses, the expressive, though awkward pantomimic motions and
gestures, the contortion of features, and the horrid _music_, present a
strange and lively picture.

Proceeding a little further, we came in sight of a noble palace, which
had been lately built, and which was surrounded by an extensive stone
wall, having the grand gate-way, or entrance, arched, and bearing the
arms of Portugal and John VI. On arriving at the palace, we found it was
built of stone, surrounded by another solid wall. At a short distance, on
the right, buildings of brick were erecting for spacious barracks. The
situation was commanding and beautiful, and we little expected to enjoy,
in a solitary country ramble, where the silence was only interrupted by
the singing of birds, the view of so noble an edifice.

On returning, we fell in with a number of female slaves, who were busily
employed in washing. They stood in a large square basin of water, at
least three feet deep, and were jabbering and rubbing, with their trays
on the banks. The country appeared well watered, and the soil very
productive.

In the city, the water is supplied by several public fountains, which are
built of stone, in a pyramidical form, from the sides of which, through
four spouts, the water is forced out in spattering streams. The principal
one is at the head of the palace steps, near the square. The slaves, who
get water from this source, to sell about the city, make a great clamor
in their contentions about first getting their vessels under the stream.

Notwithstanding the vast crowds which throng the streets, not a woman is
to be seen. Although I was at one time on shore daily, for three weeks, I
could see no other females than the slaves.—They sometimes, however, take
a ramble in the evening, but are so enveloped in cloaks that entirely
conceal their form, that a stranger would pass them, and think them men.
They may be seen, also, at the gratings of the upper windows on some
days of parade and processions, and on Sundays may be seen leaving their
palanquins to enter the church; but otherwise are confined, by tyrant
custom, to their lone apartments. How different is their fate from that
of the perambulators of Broadway and Cornhill! The population, including
slaves, probably amounts to eighty thousand. Though there are guard
houses for soldiers in many sections, murders are very frequent; so
common, indeed, that the dead body of the unfortunate victim, weltering
in blood, is passed by in the street, with, perhaps, the exclamation of
‘poor fellow!’ but other wise unheeded and without concern.

There are many foreign merchants who reside here and in the vicinity,
several of whom have their families with them; but the state of society
must prevent the enjoyment of all social intercourse, and deprive them of
those pleasures so necessary to the happiness of domestic life.

Fruits of many kinds, such as oranges, lemons, limes, plantains, bananas,
cocoa nuts, &c., are very cheap and plenty. Sugar, rice and tobacco, they
raise and export in great quantities; but should some of our chewers of
the latter article witness the nauseous method of its manufacture and
packing, by the dirty blacks, they would, I think, as I have seen others,
eject the quid in disgust. The beef is bad and lean, the cattle being
driven before they are killed, a great distance from the interior.

Multitudes of the slaves gain a profit to their owners, by the conveyance
of passengers in their canoes, to and from the shipping and the landing
places. Their strife for employment is violent and clamorous; but it
sometimes happens, if their price of fare—which must be paid on the
passage—is not agreed to, the black rogue will dexterously capsize his
canoe, tow it quickly to the shore, and leave you to be picked up by the
first passing skiff that may take that trouble.

The king’s barge is very splendid. His majesty sometimes takes an
excursion round the harbor, attended by his suite, and is rowed by
eighty men, having twenty oars on a side, and two men to each. A band of
music precedes him, and the numerous barges which follow, all handsomely
decorated, form a magnificent spectacle.

On Sundays and other holidays, the church processions are extraordinary.
On a Sunday afternoon, soon after my first arrival in Rio Jeneiro, I
witnessed a grand example of the above fetes. The streets were thronged
with a gaping multitude, who were eager to pay their devotion to the
rites of mother church. First in advance appeared a guard of soldiers,
marching to slow music; these were followed by a number of citizens,
dressed in black, each bearing a long, lighted, wax taper; then came a
small guard of soldiers, followed by four beautiful females, dressed
in light muslin, having wings of gauze, extended by wires, and crowned
with a wreath of flowers, holding in their hands emblems of a harp; and
immediately following, under a superb canopy, upheld by eight soldiers,
appeared the grand object of all this ceremony, the reverend and holy
Father of the church, to whom, as he moved along in mighty pomp and
solemn show, the crowd on each side spontaneously dropped and bowed the
knee. Another file of soldiers and citizens next came up, followed by the
underlings of the church—some of various shades of color, even to sooty
black, but who were, notwithstanding, arrayed in clerical robes—brought
up the rear of this gorgeous pageant.


LA PLATA.

In thirty four degrees south latitude, equi-distant from the equator
as New York, is the grand and majestic La Plata. On approaching the
river from the sea, the low and level land appears wholly different in
appearance from the wild and towering front along the coast of Brazil.

This vast river is a hundred and fifty miles wide at the mouth, and
extends, with a gradual contraction and in a winding direction, along the
shores of Paraguay, in the heart of South America, a distance of twelve
hundred miles. At Monte Video the water is brackish, and cannot be drank,
but at a short distance above, though it appears at all times turbid
and discolored, as if with the yellow mud at the bottom; the taste is
sweet and palatable. A sealing ship was once cast away on the rocks of
Faulkland Island, and a few of the hands with difficulty saved themselves
in the long boat. Being on a barren land, they resolved, with one barrel
of beef, which they had fortunately recovered, and a scanty supply of
water, to commit themselves to the mercy of the waves in their frail
bark, and pushed for the river of Plate. After a miserable passage and
expending their entire stock of provisions, they arrived at last, even
to the inner roads of Buenos Ayres, ascended the deck of the first vessel
they saw, and implored, ‘in the name of God,’ a draught of water!—having
traversed over a surface of one hundred miles of good fresh water,
for twenty four hours, not apprehending that it was fresh, and sailed
dismally over it, perishing with intolerable thirst.

The tides in the river, as far up as Buenos Ayres, are, in general,
regular, except when influenced by strong and constant winds, and the
rise and fall is about eight or ten feet. The bed of the river is of hard
sand, and when the tides are low no boats can come near the shore, and
many persons gain a living by conveying goods and passengers from the
boats and craft to the shore, which is sometimes a quarter of a mile.
The following fact will illustrate the power of the wind upon the water
of this river. Many years ago, during the contest with Spain, a Spanish
sloop of war was lying in the outer roads, distant at least seven miles
from the city. A succession of strong pamperos,[3] in a few days laid
bare the whole ground of the inner harbor, and the vessels and craft
were left motionless and dry. The winds still continuing to roll back
the waters, even the proud Spaniard, it was discovered, was laid bare to
the keel. Preparations were immediately made by the patriots to attack
her, in this her stationary and perilous situation. A large body of
artillerists, with some pieces of heavy cannon, descended the banks
of the river, and were drawn along on the sand by horses, and all the
bustle of a march, and preparation for battle, as on the tented field,
were seen on ground which the winds had cleared for them, and over which
the waves were wont to roar. The astonished Spaniards saw with alarm
and consternation, the approach of an enemy on horseback, where a few
days before their ship had rode in ten fathoms of water. They, however,
prepared for a desperate conflict, being resolved to defend their
ship, rather now their castle, to the last. Their fate appeared almost
certain; but fortune, for once, favored them, and accomplished more in
ten minutes, than their own greatest bravery. The action had commenced,
when an unusual shout of triumph from the deck of the Spaniard, caused
the assailants to look beyond, when with a dismay like that of Pharaoh’s
host, they beheld the surge rolling in and roaring towards them! The
battle ceased instantly—the alarm was electric—the traces were cut
from the cannons—the guns were abandoned—and they gallopped off in
full retreat, with the sea in close pursuit at their heels, and were
precipitantly driven up again, by this new enemy, from the invasion of
her possessions.

Monte Video is so called from the hill near the entrance of the harbor.
It is on the eastern side, or ‘Banda Oriental,’ of the river. It has a
good appearance from the water; but on traversing the streets, there
is nothing in the buildings to interest or admire. The houses are low,
covering a great extent of ground; generally two stories in front, and
but one in the rear, forming a square and a court or yard, in the centre.
It is strongly fortified, and the citadella or castle well garrisoned.
The city is now in possession of the Portuguese. In 1813 it was taken
by the Patriots, who invested it by sea and land for a long period, and
cut off all supplies. The famine was at last most distressingly severe,
and means at which humanity shudders, were employed to gain a pitiful
morsel to protract a miserable existence. With true Spanish obduracy,
they refused all terms, till they sold for food all they possessed, and
parents even bargained their daughters’ honor for a handful of bread.
Every thing eatable, and every living animal was devoured—horses, cats
and mules—and rats, with the immense numbers of which, the city was once
overrun, either alive or dead, sold for a dollar each! The Patriots did
not long hold possession of the city, for the Portuguese, who had always
laid claim to the lower or eastern side of the river, as the southern
bounds of the Brazil dominions, soon took possession of it, and are still
its masters. During these occurrences, the Patriot General Artigas,
of Buenos Ayres, taking offence at some measures of the government,
ambitious and well informed, deserted the common cause, and crossed the
river to Colonia, where he soon mustered a formidable body of adherents,
whom he urged to assert their independence of all other powers, and form
a separate government, though they were before considered as equally
concerned in the common cause of the country. Various detachments of
troops were sent at different times from Buenos Ayres, to subject them,
but without success, and but few returned. Artigas’ army being all
mounted, would fly when success was doubtful. Thus affairs remained till
a short time since, when this people, now called _gente_ of the ‘Banda
Oriental,’ declared war against the encroaching Portuguese, and attacked
Monte Video. The other provinces of the La Plata, deeply concerned in the
event, and being now on good terms, assisted them, at first secretly,
and at last openly, against the common enemy. The Portuguese declared
war against the Patriots in toto, and the privateers of the latter will
greatly annoy the Brazilian commerce, and probably be gainers by the
struggle.

Ensenada is a small village, situate on the same side with Buenos Ayres,
and about forty miles below. Several vessels generally lay here to take
in the jerk beef, which they carry mostly to the West Indies. The manner
of preparing this is simply by cutting off the flesh of the slaughtered
ox, and hanging it in the air to dry. No salt is used, such is the purity
of the atmosphere in this delightful climate. The entrance from the river
to the village is, as before related, through narrow, winding creeks,
on the sides of which, innumerable varieties of the feathered tribe,
twittering from grove to grove and from spray to spray, and expanding
their brilliant plumage to the sun, pour out their melodious strains of
praise to the great God of nature, whose goodness is over all, and who
delights in the happiness of all his creatures. The people are sociable
and kind, and fond of the company of strangers, particularly Americans,
whom they often amuse by their absurd and ludicrous questions respecting
the customs of other countries. The houses are low, and built of earth
and cane. The villagers are of a dark complexion, but many of the women
are fair and have peculiarly sweet voices.

Buenos Ayres, the capital of the provinces of the Rio de La Plata, has
an ancient and gloomy appearance from the water; but the traveller, on
landing, finds much to be pleased with. The streets cross each other
at right angles, and are mostly paved, with good side-walks. A street
runs along the beach, parallel with the river, nearly the whole extent
of the city, from which there is nothing to shade the prospect of the
pedestrian, who can enjoy, in his early rambles, the pure and balmy
breath of the morning, (which are here, in this southern latitude,
particularly fine) and behold the great king of day rising in the east,
as from the bed of the ocean. At the edge of the water, and below the
banks, he may see, too, from the earliest dawn till noon, an immense
number of black washer women, who line the whole extent of the shore,
for all the washing is performed in this manner. They bring down upon
their heads, large trays of clothing to the river, and select a hole or
natural excavation in the tuskers of sand, which the ebbing tide has
filled with water, and which is covered with grass; and kneeling upon
the ground, with their pipes or cigars in their mouths, commence their
labor, which is by beating instead of rubbing. They are, however, called
excellent in their business, and clean clothing is considered by all
ranks as an indispensable requisite.

During the warm months of summer, it is the practice in which all ranks
partake, to enjoy, after a sultry and dusty day, the charming refreshment
of bathing. From an hour before sunset till dark, may be seen, in the
place before occupied by the washers, a mixed multitude of many hundreds
of both sexes, and of all classes and ages, old men and children, young
men and maidens, promiscuously, and apparently with much pleasure,
performing their daily and healthy ablutions.

But start not my fair reader! Though this mixed assemblage, so employed,
would appear to the refined citizen of the north to savor of a want of
propriety, yet this luxury is enjoyed without any deviation from decency
or good breeding. Such is the force of custom. Whole families, even the
clergyman, with his household, come down and enter the water together.
The females of all ranks generally form separate parties, and are each
attended to the water side by a female slave, who carries a change of
dress and a bathing habit. Then seated on the grass and enveloped in a
sheet, they disrobe beneath their ample covering, slip on the _camisa_,
and trip into the water. There is no appearance of impropriety, but all
seem only bent on refreshing themselves, and improving this ready and
cheap bath, after the heat and the dust of the day. Let the following
anecdote corroborate. I was one afternoon, after my disaster, indulging
in my favorite recreation of swimming, at a time when the tide was fast
flowing and the waves beating to the shore. I had reached some distance
from the beach, and had gained and stood resting upon a small eminence
at the bottom, with my head only above water. I was desirous of trying
my former feats under water, and partly forgetting my disabled leg,
I plunged beneath the surface and swam a great distance farther from
the bank. On rising, I perceived the tide was fast conveying me up the
river, and it would require my strongest efforts to recover the shore,
for the waves ran quick and short. I wanted breath, and on the ability
of my lame limb I had placed too much dependence. I attempted in vain to
reach the Mole Head, and the lone sentry at the end stood wondering at
the motions of an object so far within the stream. Finding my situation
extremely hazardous, and wishing no impediment, I stripped off my nankin
pantaloons, threw them to the waves behind me, and made a last, anxious
and resolute push to the land. I succeeded so far as to reach a tusker
or sand bank, at the bottom, and on tiptoe I could keep my chin above
water, and balancing myself to the undulating swell of the waves, I
sufficiently rested myself, and luckily regained my pantaloons, which
came drifting along by me. Taking a leg of this garment in my teeth,
I ventured another stretch, which brought me breast high on the sand.
I there drew on my covering, and searched along for my dress. Various
groups had assembled on the beach during my aquatic excursion, and I was
concerned for the loss of my clothes. A black, female slave at last came
towards me, whose mistress she said had sent her to inform me that ‘she
had removed my articles of dress higher up the banks, to a safe deposite,
as the rise of the tide had threatened to sweep them away.’ I sent back
for answer, that ‘I felt infinitely obliged to her, and would cheerfully,
on a similar occasion, reciprocate the favor.’

At the extremity of the city, on an elevated plain, is the Plaza de los
Toras, in the midst of which appears a vast amphitheatre for exhibiting
the barbarous amusement, or rather cruel spectacle, of a Bull Bait. These
take place in summer, of the afternoons of Sundays, and sometimes on
other holidays. Their description must be shocking to the feelings, but
the relation of the revolting scenes certainly may be perused, when many
of the softer sex are there the applauding witnesses.

The bulls are taken from the wild herds in the interior, and they capture
those of the most fierce and wild character; in other words, those that
will give the most sport. These are driven by force and stratagem into
the adjoining stables, where their natural ferocity is increased for
several days, by starving and goading, and otherwise tormenting them.

These exhibitions are generally fully attended, and by a third part
ladies. The circular and rising seats of this amphitheatre, will contain
and will afford an equal view of the fight to ten or twelve thousand. On
one of these sights, I remember to have seen ten bulls, six horses and
one human being killed, and another wounded, in the space of three hours.

Every thing being ready, the bulls remained to be driven across the
area from the stables where they were, to a smaller stable behind the
amphitheatre, where each was to be kept apart. The first stable was not
far from the amphitheatre, and a wall of boards six feet high was put
up the whole way the bulls were to pass. At a quarter past four the
ten bulls were let into the area, in order to be put into the stables
at the opposite door; a man on foot led a tame ox, which had been bred
with the bulls, before, to decoy them into these: they followed the ox
very quietly; but they do not always do so. The three horsemen placed
themselves at some distance, one on each side of, and the other opposite
to the door at which the bull was to enter; the tap of a drum was the
signal to let a bull in, and the man who opened the door got behind it
immediately.

During this last quarter of an hour the bulls had been teazed by pricking
them in the backs; this is done by persons placed on the ceiling of the
stables, which was low, and consisted only of a plank laid here and
there, and between those planks was space enough to use any instrument
for that purpose. The bulls were distinguished by a small knot of ribbon
fixed to their shoulders, the different colors of which shew where they
were bred, which is known by the advertisements.

The bull made at the first horseman, who received him on the point of the
spear, held in the middle tight to his side, and passing under his arm
pit, which making a wide gash in the bull’s shoulder, occasioned him to
draw back, the blood running in torrents; the force with which the bull
ran at the man, was so great, that the shock had nearly overset him and
his horse. It was then another man’s turn to wound the bull, as only one
is to cope with it at a time. They are never allowed to attack the bull,
but must wait the animal’s approach. The bull trotted into the middle of
the area, and stared about, frighted by the clapping and hallooing of the
multitude. The man on horseback always facing the beast, and turning when
it turned; it then ran at the horse, and got another wound in the breast,
and a third from the next horseman it attacked. It was now become mad
with pain, the blood issuing from its mouth in streams, and faintness
made it stagger; its eyes ‘flashed fury,’ it pawed up the ground, and
lashed its sides with its tail; its breath was impetuously discharged
like smoke from its nostrils, so that its head appeared as if in a mist.
A drum then sounded, which was a signal for the horsemen to retire; and
the men on foot began their attack, sticking barbed darts into every
part of its body; the torture they inflicted made the bull leap from the
ground, and run furiously at one of the men, who jumped aside; the bull
then turned to another man, who had just stuck a dart into his back; the
man took to his heels, and leaped over the rails, where he was safe; in
this manner all the men continued tormenting the bull, who could hardly
stand through loss of blood. The drum then sounded again, upon which the
matador appeared, with a cloak extended on a short stick in his left
hand, and in his right a two-edged sword, the blade of which was flat,
four inches broad, and a yard long; he stood still, and at the moment the
bull in the agonies of despair and death, made at him, he plunged the
sword into the spine behind the beast’s horns, which instantly made it
drop down dead. If the matador misses his aim, and cannot defend himself
with the cloak, he loses his life, as the bull exerts all its remaining
strength with an almost inconceivable fury. The dead bull was immediately
dragged out of the area by three horses on a full gallop, whose traces
were fastened to its horns. A quarter of an hour was elapsed, which
is the time allowed for the murder of each bull, five minutes to the
horsemen, five to the footmen, and five to the slayer.

Another bull was then let in; this was the wildest and most furious of
any I ever saw. The horseman missed his aim, and the bull thrust his
horns into the horse’s belly, making the bowels hang out; the horse
became ungovernable, so that the man was obliged to dismount and abandon
it to the bull, who pursued it round the area, till the horse fell and
expired. Four other horses were successively killed by this bull, which
till then, had only received slight wounds, though one of the horses had
kicked its jaw to pieces. One of the horsemen broke his spear in the
bull’s neck, and horse and rider fell to the ground; the rider broke
his leg, and was carried off. The footmen then fell to work again, and
afterwards the matador put an end to the life of this valiant animal,
whose strength and courage were unavailing to save it. The third bull
killed two horses, goring them under the belly, so that the intestines
hung trailing on the ground. The seventh bull likewise killed two horses.
In this manner were ten bulls massacred, and the whole concluded in two
hours and a half. The bull’s flesh was immediately sold to the populace
at ten quartos per pound, which is about three pence.

When the last bull had been sufficiently wounded by the horsemen, the
mob were allowed to enter the area; they attacked the bull on all sides,
and killed it with their knives and daggers. The bull sometimes tosses
some of these fellows over its head.’

It should be remembered that in the interior, around the circle, are
double walls of oak, with sally ports to the inner one, and a passage way
between them of three feet wide. These apertures are sufficient to admit
a man, but the _toro_ cannot enter. Through these, when hotly pursued,
the gladiator will escape, and the bull vents his rage on the impregnable
walls.

A powerful black bull was now let in, and made instantly and without a
stop, at the horseman, who stood ready, twenty feet from the door, with
his spear firmly balanced and pointed to receive him. The aim was true,
but the point struck a bone, which threw the horse upon his hind legs,
and a lance twelve feet long, of an arm’s thickness, was shivered to
pieces. The furious animal directly pursued his advantage, and the horse
was overthrown, with the rider underneath him, whose case was at this
time extremely dangerous. Generally, at the first wound of the spear, the
bull will turn off in another direction; but when they push on, as those
of a savage nature sometimes will, the horse is thrown to the ground,
and the spearsman’s situation is, of course, very perilous. Such was the
wonderful strength of the bull in this case, that the struggling horse
was lifted free from the ground by the surprising power of his enemy’s
horns, apparently with the ease that an apple might be raised by a fork.
With difficulty, however, the rider extricated himself, and attempted to
fly. The gladiators on foot ran to his rescue, and attempted, with their
bright colored mantles, to draw off the beast and divert him from his
purpose; but mad with rage, and scorning their efforts, he jumped across
the prostrate horse, (drawing out his horns from his body) and quickly
pursued his biped foe. The latter strained every nerve to reach the
port-hole, and one hand was even within it, but the horns of his pursuer
were the next instant in his ribs, and he was impaled against the wall.
He was an old man, of a dreadful, cruel and relentless countenance; had
committed many unprovoked murders, and was once condemned to be shot;
but he chose rather to hazard his life weekly against wild beasts in the
ring, and at last, having been twenty years so perilously employed, was
thus killed by a brute of a nature nearly akin to his own.

At any feat of dexterity from the gladiator, handfuls of dollars are
sometimes thrown by the rich spectators, which he deliberately picks up
and pockets, amid the shouts of ‘bravo!’ and the waving of handkerchiefs.

A party will sometimes be seated and regaling themselves at a table
opposite the doors in the lists, and a bull will be let out upon them, at
which they take to flight, with their bottles; except one bold fellow,
who leaps from the table, vaulting over the bull’s horns, and lights
straddling upon his back, facing his tail, while chairs, table, &c.,
are tossed about his head. At other times, a solitary fighter will be
stationed on one knee, a few feet from the entrance, with a short thick
pike, very sharp, pointed toward the door, with the butt end firmly fixed
in the ground, and wait the victim’s approach. This is the most ready
way of death; for the bull, driving at the object, makes fiercely for
the recumbent and watchful foe, but drops before he reaches him, for
the pike head is buried in his brain. But enough has been said of such
heart-hardening scenes.

We will now turn to a custom of less savage, and of a wholly different
character—to the three holidays, (which they zealously celebrate) called
the time of ‘Carnival.’ On these days, all business is suspended, and
woe to the landed stranger, of whatever rank, who shall attempt to pass
through the streets of the city. The flat and low roofs of the houses,
are thronged with the women, whose slaves have provided them with a
large supply of water in tubs, and with which they inundate the luckless
passenger below. The field officer on horseback, and the poor _paysano_
from the country, share alike the effects of their deluging streams—the
horsemen will by speed attempt to escape the shower; but tubs are emptied
far in advance, from the watchful throng above, in quick succession.

The men are no less busy in the streets, annoying the other sex, who are
frequently pursued even to their inner chambers. No offence can be or
must be taken, and no redress may be expected for mischief done.

Many of the boys get a few rials, by the carrying about in baskets and
vending of egg shells, filled with scented water and closed with wax,
which the men buy and pocket, and pelt every female with them, who
inconsiderately exposes herself to their attacks. On a time like this,
I once saw from my lodgings, a party of a dozen, who assailed a house a
short distance below, on the opposite side of the street. The windows
have iron gratings from top to bottom, by means of which, a person can
ascend and scale the walls and gain the roof. A part of these sporters
made this attempt, while the women on the terrace, assisted by their
slaves, discharged their torrents and poured a flood on the heads of
the besiegers. They at last gained the terrace, and the women fled to
their lower apartments, pursued by the enemy. Here they made a stand
and beseeched their invaders to proceed no farther, and appealed to
the honor and generosity of cavalleros, not to invade the privacy of a
lady’s chamber. The appeal was effective, and they instantly desisted and
turned to retire; but seeing the enemy’s magazines of water in large,
low hogsheads, and the slaves who had so obstinately repulsed them
standing near, they could not resist the temptation, and seizing at once
the screaming blacks, they deliberately plunged them headlong into the
vessels, and made a speedy retreat.

The Theatre is a low and miserable looking edifice, (though a new one
was remaining unfinished) and the performers at a par with the building.
It is, however, well attended, and the second or upper range of seats
is filled wholly with women. The prompter’s head appears from an
aperture in the centre of the stage, with a lamp before him, and whose
voice is as audible as the players, who repeat after him. I went once
to see Shakspeare murdered, and a scene in the afterpiece furnished a
circumstance that will afford a finishing picture to this brief outline.
The farce was called the ‘Haunted House,’ the possessor of which wished
to get rid of his nocturnal and troublesome visiters. He had summoned a
procession of the holy order to purify the premises; but the number of
players, otherwise fully engaged, being too small for this purpose, they
hit upon a very ready though _outre_ expedient to supply the deficiency.
The church of San Domingo stood on the opposite corner, and application
was there made, upon the pinch, for a supply of its disciples, and a
dozen were engaged at a rial a piece. These shortly appeared upon the
stage, in _propria persona_, with belt and hood, and holy water, which
they sprinkled profusely around, chaunting ‘_Anda te diablo_.’

There is a conveyance—a clumsy vehicle, drawn by six horses—which leaves
here once a month for Chili, proceeding as far as the foot of the Andes.
Here, leaving their horses, the travellers are obliged to mount on
mules, as being more sure footed than horses, and the passages over the
mountains are, at certain places, narrow and dangerous. The mule only can
be here rode with safety, on account of the narrow passages winding along
the sides of these stupendous mountains. The astonished traveller, when
traversing along this ridge of frightful precipices, beholds with dismay
the yawning chasms beneath him, where the least mis-step would infallibly
and irrecoverably plunge him in the fearful abyss below. He follows, in
breathless silence, the slow and steady motions of his guide, who directs
him to slack his reins, to preserve perfect silence, to leave the beast
to its own guidance, and even if tottering with dizziness, to close his
eyes. These injunctions need no repetition. Sometimes, in the lower
places, in thick and misty weather, the guides will lose the track and
wander till they regain it several days in the snow. This a Dutch captain
once told me was his case, and he was much harrassed by the hard riding,
and sick even at the sight of a horse. The passage is generally performed
in about twenty days, and the distance from Buenos Ayres to St. Jago or
Lima, is about four hundred leagues.

During the war with the royalists in the interior, the Buenos Ayrean
troops gained many important victories. On these occasions the public
square was splendidly decorated, having arches formed of large trees,
and on the branches in the centre of each of these, were suspended lamps,
and all the verdant pillars were profusely supplied with large wax
candles, of a yard in length and of an arm’s thickness, as well as the
monument in the centre, which, when lighted in the evening, produce the
brilliancy of a noon-day blaze.

A large platform was erected on one of these occasions, in the midst of
the square, and a grand dance performed by a volunteer party of young
gentlemen, who were arrayed in the fashion of the native Peruvians,
having a flesh colored velvet dress, with a band of large variegated
feathers around their heads, and another about the loins. They went
through the evolutions with much grace and received great applause. The
music was by a superior band, which was placed on an elevated station a
short distance from them.

Horses, bullocks, dogs and sheep, in these vast regions, run wild, in
immense flocks and herds. The swine are of small size, and always black.
The hunters, at certain seasons, form parties to procure the hides and
tallow of the wild cattle, and leave the carcases to be devoured by the
dogs.

These latter animals abound here in infinite variety and numbers.
Here may be seen the bull dog, mastiff, pointer, water dog, terrier,
spaniel, butcher, shepherd, and ship dog, and sometimes all in a company
together. Some of them are of formidable size, and often dangerous to the
traveller, as I once experienced.

On a lovely morning—during my lameness—in the month of February, which
is, in this latitude, mid-summer, I took my fowling piece, and at day
break sauntered along the river side after game. Before the sun rises,
ducks are often plenty about the little ponds at the extremity of the
city. I wanted to try my gun, and a drove of horses passing slowly
along enabled me to approach within shot of a couple of large birds,
like cranes, which were stalking about in the water. I fired and killed
one and wounded the other, who made off with his broken wing into the
water, and the dead one I drew up on the beach and hid him in the grass,
resolving to take him on my return. He measured nearly five feet high,
his legs being two feet long, of a bright red; his neck was very long,
and his body covered with beautiful snow white plumage. Proceeding, I
found the ducks were, at this time, unusually shy, and I had got but
half a dozen. I then put in a heavier charge and larger shot, in hopes
of touching a group of swans which I saw in a small pond far ahead, but
could not get near them, and the sun being now up, I resolved to strike
across the fields and gain the high road to the city, from which I had
wandered nearly two miles. In passing through some olive trees, I was
started by a rustling noise on my left, which caused me to turn round,
when I saw a large dog cutting through the bushes, open mouthed, towards
me! As I knew I must fight, for I could not run, I grounded the breech
of my gun, and in an erect and steady attitude, hoping to dismay him,
awaited his coming up. He soon did so, making directly towards me, and
trying, with great ferocity, to get a bite at my leg behind. This I
found he soon would succeed in, and with a quick movement I altered my
position, and bending down, presented my piece with the muzzle to his
head, and following him round as he endeavored to get behind me, he
being within a few inches, I hastily cocked and fired. He received in
his shoulder the whole charge of swan shot, yet desisted not. Seizing
then the barrel, I gave him a blow with the butt of the gun, and forced
him to yield, when he set up a yell, and went howling upon three legs. I
instantly began to reload, for I saw a second dog, equally formidable,
approaching at full speed, to assist his companion. The latter luckily
fell down as the second dog reached him, who smelt for a moment about his
prostrate comrade, then turned tail and retreated.

The milk is brought in and cried about the city by country boys, from
seven to fourteen years old, on horseback, who have a peculiar song of
their own, which I never could interpret, by which they give notice of
their approach. The milk is contained in earthen jugs, placed in panniers
made of hide, on each side of the horse, holding three jugs each.
Notwithstanding the infinity of horses, I never saw a mare in the streets
of Buenos Ayres; and a person riding one would be subject to derision
and abuse, as much as if he were mounted on a cow, mares being kept only
for breeding. Horses may here be bought from one to twenty dollars, but
mules are much more valuable—not for being less plenty, but because
they are more difficult to tame, and are truly of a most perverse and
obstinate nature. They are sometimes exported to the Cape of Good Hope.

A vessel at sea had once a cargo of these beasts on board, when a
violent storm arose, in which they broke from their fasts in the hold
and ascended upon deck; here they fell to kicking and biting, and drove
the mariners aloft, and the man at the helm also fled. The bark carried
away her masts, and every thing threatened a wreck. At last, by the help
of some spars, they succeeded in pushing a dozen of their mad passengers
overboard; and driving the rest below, regained command of the ship, and
put back for repairs.

Leopards, lions and wild cats are plenty, but I do not think their
natures so savage as those of Africa. The leopards, which they call
_tigres_, are very large, and their beautiful skins are sold very cheap.

The ostriches are very strong birds, and will ride a stout boy on their
backs. They eat the most indigestive substances, such as iron, stone and
wood. They are a coarse and dirty looking bird, and those bright and
tasty feathers they afford, are plucked from their tails, where the long
ones only grow.

Fruits of many kinds are plenty, especially melons, grapes and peaches.
These, as well as every thing else in this most fertile country, are
cultivated with little labor, and the soil, I believe, would produce, in
abundance and perfection, every thing desired, if the natives were not
too careless and indolent to bestow an effort to cultivate them. This
indolence, it has been said, may be attributed to this very fertility of
soil and softness of climate, and as the earth here gives her increase
without much labor, they have not the necessity for toil as those of a
less yielding and more rocky region.

The general character of the people of these vast provinces is mild and
peaceable; they are rather indolent, but hospitable in the extreme.
They are incessant smokers, and fond of a sip from a gourd shell of the
favorite _yerba_, rather than the stronger liquors. This _yerba_ is an
indispensable beverage with all ranks, and is instantly made by merely
pouring hot water (which is ever at hand) to the _matte_, in the shell.
They suck this very hot, through a tube. This liquor is always offered to
visiters, and passed and repassed from guest to guest.

The women are generally below the usual stature, with expressive black
eyes, black hair, flute-like voices, and dress and walk when abroad with
much circumspection, and flirt the fan—their constant appendage—with
exquisite grace and skill. The complexions of some are tinged; but many,
as I before observed, are extremely fair; and some, I have thought,
approached, in form and feature, the nearest to the perfection of beauty
of any I had ever seen. The country girls smoke cigars, and all the sex
are extremely fond of flowers, which they rear in great profusion and
in infinite variety. On entering the hospitable and social dwellings
of the farmers, the matte cup, the cigar and a bunch of flowers, are
always presented. They are remarkably temperate, and I have often seen
the teamsters at a pulperia or shop, passing around a single glass of
_aguadente_, or rum, which they would leisurely sip, and which was amply
sufficient for half a dozen men.

The country carts, in which they transport their produce from the
interior, deserve notice. They are the most awkward, heavy and singular
vehicles ever seen; and one of them passing through our streets, would
attract as much notice as a moving menagerie. The cart is, in fact, about
the height of a two story house, the sides and roof formed of flags and
cane, but the bottom of hard and solid wood, which, with the wheels, are
monstrously clumsy. On the front part of the wagon, under the arched
roof, in an elevated station, sits the driver. Over his head is suspended
and poised, a stout pole, of great length, which extends from the cart to
the foremost of the six yoke of oxen; the end of this is spear-pointed,
and by moving the inner end, he can touch and guide the leading yoke. In
his hand he holds a shorter pole, also pointed, with which he governs the
nearer cattle. Lashed on with hide strings, at the tail of the cart, is
a large earthen jar, of twenty gallons, to contain water. Thus furnished,
the machine moves at a slow pace, and as they never grease the axles, the
creak of the wheels may be heard a mile distant.

When the caravan halts to encamp, they choose a vacant and convenient
place, and making a fire, prepare for supper. They drive stakes into
the ground, on which, against the fire, they stretch a piece of beef
to roast, and then squatting in a circle around, and with a kettle of
matte only, thus eat their simple but plentiful meal, with great relish,
without bread or salt, the remnants of which last them through the next
day.

At the vesper hour in the city, at sun set, the stranger who walks the
streets is amazed at the sudden and simultaneous stop of the passing
multitude at the solemn toll of the bell. Looking around him, he sees
each uncovered passenger standing like a statue, and every sound is
hushed to silence.

In passing a church, all ranks lift the hat; even the milk boy, and the
abovementioned wagoner, will simultaneously raise his _sombrero_.

Another equally superstitious and universal custom deserves a passing
notice. I was once, on a fine afternoon, about sun set, seated at an
extensive table, in the spacious court yard of a coffee house, amidst a
vast number of officers, priests, and citizens, partaking of a cup of
their excellent _cafe solo_, when suddenly was heard, at a distance,
the tinkling of a small bell, of a well known and peculiar sound.
Every one present, even to the waiters, hastily left their seats, and
thronging to the doors and windows, fell upon their knees and awaited
the approach of the sacred host. A heavy, old fashioned coach, profusely
gilt, drawn by four mules, soon slowly appeared, surrounded with a guard
of four soldiers. When abreast of the prostrate devotees, they all fell
to crossing themselves and repeating the _pater noster_. This venerable
carriage contains a holy father, who goes to administer the sacrament
of extreme unction to some departing catholic. Frequently in passing
the street, I have been obliged, at the sound of this reverenced bell,
to step over the heads of the kneeling group at the door, and retreat
from the indignity of kneeling to an old coach and half starved mules.
Obedience to this rite, even from strangers, is rigidly enforced; and an
English naval captain, in full dress for a ball, was once compelled to
get upon his knees, and arose vowing vengeance and leaving his scented
cambric handkerchief in the mud.

There is a nunnery of a very strict order in the lower part of the city,
and I once had lodgings within the sound of its midnight bell, whose
solemn toll, at the dead hour of twelve, summoned the inmates to their
nightly devotions.

The ceremony of taking the veil is extremely impressive and affecting.
The individual, I believe, has her own unbiassed choice, in thus
retreating from the world, and the motives probably are loss of friends,
unhappy attachments, or, perhaps, a melancholy disposition. The parent
or guardian pays a large sum to the institution, and the applicant is
admitted on trial. At the expiration of this term, if she still resolves
to embrace this solitary life, she confirms her purpose in the assembled
church, by taking the veil.

In one case, a modest young creature, about the age of sixteen,
interesting, beautiful, and just blooming into womanhood, was presented
to the gaze of the spectators, and appeared to attest to this mournful
resolution. As her attendants unbound her hair, and the ample tresses
fell upon her shoulders, and the profusion of jetty ringlets were severed
from her reclining and finely formed head, there arose in the mind a
throb of painful feeling, from the contemplation that this fair being was
about taking a last look at the bright scenes around her; and that such
youth and beauty should be immured for life within the cold walls of a
convent, and the ends of creation be thus perverted by the iron sway of
tyrant custom.

These absurd ceremonies are derived from the all pervading influence of
the priests, who blind the eyes of the people, and strive to keep them in
ignorance and error. Even the blessing and privilege of possessing and
reading the bible is denied them; indeed, but few of the lower class can
read at all.

To keep up their power, the priests use every means to prevent the
spread of knowledge; for full well they know, that should the minds
of the people be enlightened, common sense would prevail, and they
would awake to their impositions, and throw off the debasing yoke of
superstition; and priestcraft would expire.

The multitude of padres, priests, friars, _clericos_ and church
dependents, is incredible, and compose a large portion of the population.
They may be seen in all places, with full, contented faces, under their
broad brimmed hats, reverenced and bowed to by all; living upon the fat
of the land, and one may enter without ceremony all parts of any house at
any hour, without fear of interruption, on leaving his hat and cane in
the passage—‘he is confessing the females, and must not be disturbed.’

There is one of the canine species here, as also in Brazil, of a mouse
color and without hair! At Ensenada, I saw one of this kind; he was full
grown, though not larger than a rat. His body was of a jet black, with a
shining, smooth skin, without hair or even down, excepting at the tip of
his tail and on the crown of his head. He was of a perfect and handsome
form, nimble in his motions, and would bark and play with the manners
of a lady’s lap dog. I regretted that I could not obtain him, for I
considered him a very curious animal.

Fish in great plenty swarm in the river, and are some of them of a
beautiful appearance. In the market, some may be seen for sale, four
feet long, with gold colored scales, some of a silvery hue, and a great
variety of other kinds, of which, a species of fresh water cat fish are
the most numerous, and the cheapest.

Beef is sold without weighing, often at seventy five cents per quarter;
and a whole sheep, ready dressed, for twenty five cents!

The slaves are always well used and fed, and the majority appear to be as
much at leisure, and full as happy as their masters.

In the warm months of summer, between the hours of two and four, a person
may walk through the city and not meet any moving object, a deathlike
stillness pervading the once bustling and crowded streets. From the
scorching rays of a verticle sun, they retire to the recesses and shades,
to enjoy, in the arms of Morpheus, their favorite _siesta_, or afternoon
nap. At this time, none but dogs and Englishmen, they say, (by which term
they mean all foreigners) are to be seen in the streets. The shutters of
the shops and houses are closed; the muleteers and _peones_ are snoring
under the piazzas, and the dogs are stretched out under cover; while the
shopkeeper is sleeping on his counter, and the drayman under the shadow
of his cart. I have said they are _enjoying_ their siesta, but there is
one drawback upon their comfort—_fleas_!—which here abound in numbers
without number. The habitations having all brick floors, afford ample
retreats for these formidable disturbers of dreams.

The _paysanos_ are wonderfully expert on horseback; yet having for a
saddle, only a few pieces of square cloth and leather, and triangular
wooden stirrups, with green hide straps, into which they hook the great
toe. Their method of catching the wild cattle is very dexterous and
singular. They are provided with _lassos_, which is a strip of hide
line thirty feet long, with an iron ring and noose at one end, and the
other secured to the saddle, at the side of which the coil is suspended.
Having selected an animal from the herd, the _guacha_ takes the coil in
his hand, and swinging it fairly around his head a few times, still in
chase, throws out the noose with surprising good aim, the distance of
twenty feet, which falls over the bullock’s head, and turning his horse,
draws tight and secures him by his horns; another hunter in the rear then
throws a second noose, which entraps his hind legs, and by pulling in
opposite directions, the bull is easily overthrown.

The _estancias_, or large farms, in the interior, are very productive
and profitable, and the fertility of the soil and the salubrity of the
climate, in these provinces, render the profession of the physician
little room for active service.

To conclude—the people, by which I mean the middling and higher classes,
are of amiable dispositions, strong natural sense, eager for information,
and ardent lovers of liberty; highly honoring their military chieftains,
and often speaking with enthusiastic pride of the heroic and beloved
Bolivar. The march of mind, in these vast territories, must keep
pace with the rapid strides of liberty, and truth and knowledge will
ultimately prevail over despotism and superstition. Living in this
delightful clime, and possessing this fruitful soil, with their devoted
love of country, and their ardent thirst for knowledge, the speculative
and contemplative mind of the philosopher and philanthropist may look
forward—piercing the veil of futurity—and behold the native of Paraguay
and the rough Patagonian, enjoying with the Chilian and the Peruvian, the
invaluable blessing of an enlightened government; and tribes yet unknown,
filling, at the sound of the Sabbath bell, the consecrated temples of the
Most High.

    Far in the west, beneath auspicious skies,
    In fertile vales, see mighty nations rise!
    Where the stain’d savage chas’d the bounding deer,
    See crowded marts and towering spires appear.
    In eastern climes, though freedom’s torch expires,
    Here it shall flame, and still increase its fires.
    On fam’d Parnassus, tho’ extinct her light,
    It proudly burns on Chimborazo’s height.
    Sad Greece! with foes in fearful odds at bay,
    While christian nations doubt to join the fray,
    And friends forsake, nor prayers nor valor heed—
    (Shame to their souls!)—in this thy utmost need.
    Yet courage, Greece! thy cherish’d name shall live,
    And in its ancient glory shall revive;
    Yes! freedom’s car o’er every realm shall roll,
    And spread her choicest gifts from pole to pole;
    Oppression’s chains to endless night be hurl’d,
    And INDEPENDENCE crown a smiling world!
