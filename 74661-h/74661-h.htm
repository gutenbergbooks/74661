<p>The haste in which the former edition
of this little journal was written and sent
to the press, produced several errors and
omissions, which, in this, I have endeavored
to correct and supply; adding, also,
a short account of the situation, population
and customs of those places mentioned
in the narrative.</p>

<p>No spectacle on earth, perhaps, which
the eye of man can witness, is fraught
with so much interest, sublimity and
terror, and no situation is so awful and
appalling, as a midnight shipwreck at sea.
In my youth, I read, with unsatiated
avidity, the voyages and disasters of the
adventurous seaman, and I believe the
desire for such information is planted in
every human heart.</p>

<p>The remarkable event of one only surviving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
in a total shipwreck, naturally
awakens a curiosity to learn the particulars,
and by what extra chances he alone
fortunately reached the shore. The following
is a tale of this complexion,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Torn from the bosom of the raging sea.’</div>

</div>

<p>A few words in its defence are now
necessary. Several persons have indirectly
expressed their disbelief, totally or
in part, of the events I have related, and
have probably been so induced, from a
few strained expressions which occur in
the relation. These should have been
overlooked in a tale which should have
been penned with</p>

<p>That a ship of the name and description
mentioned in these pages, sailed
from such port, at such time, with such
a company, and freighted with such a
cargo, as I have described; that said ship
never reached her port of destination;
and that some time afterwards, the wreck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of a large vessel was discovered on the
shores of the La Plata; are facts which
no one, I presume, will deny, for they
can be easily and readily proved. If thus
far is admitted, what remains to doubt?</p>

<p>It is the events, then, related in the interim,
in which I was ultimately, and for
some days, sole actor, which savors of
the marvellous. But is it so incredible,
that in a storm where twenty two perished
in a short time and in a fearful manner,
and but one escaped, that that one
should be beset with peril, should win his
way, with great difficulty, to the shore,
and suffer the disasters he has attempted
to describe? I have said thus much to
destroy these surmises, which, though
indirect and untenable, are grating to the
feelings. The nature of this part of the
case precluding the possibility of ocular
evidence, I can only pledge, in support
of its truth, my word of honor. All else
relating to the ship may be confirmed by
the testimony of several gentlemen now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
living in neighboring towns, who were
merchants resident at Buenos Ayres at
the time, and who were well acquainted
with the transactions, which were never
doubted there. But enough—while others
may stagger at the story, and wonder
that he alone should survive; with him,
that he escaped at all, will be the theme
of the greatest wonder, and of the deepest
gratitude.</p>

</div>

<p>I sailed from New York in the ship Ocean,
Captain. F., October, 1816, for the River of Plate.
The patriot consul from the republic of Buenos
Ayres, resident there, had contracted with and engaged
a French officer of rank, with eighteen others,
who were under his direction, for the service of
his government. This personage had been formerly
a colonel under Bonaparte, and commanded a regiment
of Polish lancers—himself, by birth a Pole.
He had accompanied Napoleon to Plymouth in the
Bellorephon, and being denied a passage with him
to St. Helena, left England, and sailed, with several
inferior officers, to the United States. Here
they were engaged, as before mentioned, by the
envoy. Our ship was fitted out for their reception,
and owned by Mr. H., then high sheriff of New
York. Besides these, we had eight other Frenchmen
as passengers, who were mechanics, architects,
&amp;c., and three Americans, comprising, with the
ship’s crew, a goodly company of about forty seven
persons. We loosed the sails, with a moderate
breeze and fair, though somewhat hazy. Nothing
material occurred till the third day out, when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
experienced a storm, which lasted, with great violence,
about three hours; about dark it abated.
We had got the ship under snug sail, and wearied
with the labor of the day, I retired with the chief
mate below, intending to broach a wine pipe, of
which we had two stowed on end, under the after
hatchway, to drink farewell to our homes and success
to our ship. On proceeding from the cabin,
through a passage to the steerage, we discovered
by the lantern, a face which I had not before recognised
on board. The man was decently dressed,
sitting between the water casks, picking a bone.
On being interrogated, he told us he was an Irishman,
of the name of O’Brien; that bad luck had
brought him there, having lost his money; and that
he had smuggled himself on board. I acquainted
the captain with the discovery, and the affair terminated
by setting him to work as cook’s mate; in
which capacity he afterwards proved a very useful
fellow. The interference of the French passengers
in the affairs of the ship, gave us much trouble, for
which the tars paid themselves on crossing the line.</p>

<p>It had been reported in the papers of the day, at
New York, previous to our sailing, that the Portuguese
had declared war against the patriots of the
La Plata, had seized on Monte Video, and were
blockading the port of Buenos Ayres. On Sunday
morning, eighty two days out, we passed Monte Video,
in full sight, with a stiff breeze. The day was
bright and beautiful, and the appearance of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
walled city as we were borne along upon the bosom
of the majestic La Plata, was to us, who so long
had seen nothing but the ocean and the sky, highly
gratifying. Abreast of the harbor, lay a Portuguese
seventy four and several frigates; we ran within
cannon shot of the former, she firing one gun, which
we did not regard, but continued our course in an
oblique direction across the river, to gain the south
channel. About four, P. M., we discovered the opposite
shore, and ran within three miles of it, when
we struck upon a shoal; the bottom, fortunately,
was of soft mud, though the swell of the sea caused
the ship to strike very heavily. We imagined it to
be the Chico Bank, as we thought Point India
Shoal, which, in fact, we were thumping upon,
could not extend so far from the land; the helmsman
was therefore ordered to keep the ship’s head
in shore, in order to pass between the bank and the
main; but this movement soon caused her to strike
so heavily as to throw three or four off their legs,
and much alarmed the passengers. On perceiving
our error, we immediately braced round the sails
and steered off shore, and after striking again several
times, found ourselves once more in deep water.
The navigation at this part of the river is very difficult
and dangerous. Night approaching, we soon
after lessened sail and came to anchor in about ten
fathoms, and remained thus for the night.</p>

<p>At day break we again loosened the sails and
proceeded up the river. Capt. F. and the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
were upon the look-out aloft, greatly anxious for
the result of this day’s proceedings; the Frenchmen
dreading the Portuguese, and expecting hourly to
be boarded by a man of war and taken prisoners,
and the captain also concerned for the safety of his
ship. At ten, A. M., they discovered, from aloft,
several vessels, far ahead, which, enveloped partly
in the floating mist of the morning, loomed like
men of war. The merchant vessels in the outer
roads of Buenos Ayres are discovered before you
can see the city, from which they are distant eight
or ten miles; where, also, is stationed, at all times,
an English frigate or sloop of war. These, I assured
the agitated Frenchmen, were the ships they
now saw; but their fears construed them into the
dreaded Portuguese squadron, and their opinion
could not be shaken. The captain ordered the ship
to be brought to. The sails were clued up, the anchor
dropped, and the long boat hoisted out and got
alongside. While doing this, I was sent for in the
cabin, where the captain requested me to get in
readiness, with four men, to go in the boat and take
the French officers on shore. They seemed convinced,
he said, that the ships ahead are enemies,
and are willing to take the chance of landing here,
rather than to fall into their hands. I received
some dollars to pay expenses, immediately mustered
the baggage of the soldiers, and with the general
and nine others, pushed off from the ship and made
for the shore, distant about five miles. We landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
about four, P. M., running the boat on the beach,
as she had leaked half full of water, and commenced
unlading the cargo, which comprised all the officers’
trunks, bedding, armour, side arms, &amp;c., and
a small stock of provisions. These were carried
through the bushes to an elevated spot, where there
grew a thicket of small sized trees, by the help of
which, the passengers began to erect a kind of arbor,
while I left them, with two of the seamen, to
explore the country, which, probably, before we
landed, the human foot had never trod. The soil
we found very wet, and almost impenetrable from
the thick growth of tall reeds. I saw, over the
rushes, afar off, a rising ground and a tree, and
thinking it would be a good place for further observations,
I resolved to gain it. Our only method of
advancing was by parting the rushes on each side
with our arms, and breaking through the bushes or
creeping under the small trees, which grew here in
the thick luxuriance of unmolested nature. But for
the greatest distance, our only method of progressing
was, to lay ourselves at length on the rushes
and pressing them to the ground, to proceed again
alternately. We gained, at last, the desired eminence,
and I ascended the tree, but could perceive
nothing of a habitation or cattle, though we had
seen the prints of animals’ feet.</p>

<p>By the time we returned, we found the wind,
which had been increasing, now blew a gale on
shore; a large surf was rolling in upon the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
which at once convinced us of the impossibility of
making our way through it in our leaky boat, back
to the ship; we were therefore compelled to make
the best of necessity, and to remain on shore; I
directed the men to bring the boat into a small
cove which made into the land, and the anchor to
be carried up the beach and secured. She then
rode in her little bay in safety. It now began to
thicken around and to grow dark and tempestuous,
which urged us to turn our thoughts to the means
of shelter and comfort, during what foreboded a
dreary, cold and stormy night. We took a scanty
supper of some cold ham and ship bread, and one
bottle of brandy, which nearly consumed our stock
of provisions; then, at the suggestion of the general,
all hands turned to in cutting down armfuls of
the long rushes which grew so thick around, to
serve for beds, and in breaking down the branches
of decayed trees, &amp;c., for fuel. The ground was
every where very wet, and no dry spot could be
found; these rushes we strewed very thickly on the
ground, in the most open place we could find, in
the form of a circle, upon which we were to repose.
In the centre of this we made half a dozen large
fires, and then set the watch, myself and four seamen,
as we concluded to let the soldiers do as best
pleased them, which watch was to commence at
twelve, midnight, till which time I was to keep
guard; after which, the sailors two hours each, till
morning. This was necessary in order to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
fires replenished, for it was freezing cold, to protect
us from wild beasts, and to take care of our
boat. At twelve I called the next in turn and laid
down, to try the experiment, if weariness could repose
upon a flint, for I had a stone for my pillow,
or what was worse, upon the wet ground. I had
no outside covering, neither had the seamen, but
labor compelled us to sleep. I awoke about day-light,
and my feelings were indescribable; the morning
was boisterous, the fires were wholly extinct,
and had been so a long time. The men from fatigue
had fallen into a deep sleep, and snoring
around. I attempted to rise, but was surprised to
find my limbs so stiff and nerveless; my senses too
seemed almost as stiff as my bones, I felt light
headed, and half crazy, the effect of sleeping on
wet ground. I walked round in search of the general,
who was lying with his associates in a cluster,
on the opposite side of the fires, well sheltered from
the severity of the night and the earth, by their
mattresses, and ample coverings of surtouts, cloaks
and wrappers. I acquainted him of my intention
of returning on board the ship. He then pencilled
a note to Captain F. informing him he was resolved
to endeavor to penetrate by land to Ensenada,
and from whence, should he arrive there, to
send down a conveyance for his men. We then
pushed off with the boat, and after a long and strong
pull reached the ship; on entering on board we found
but two men, the captain and cook; the seamen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
wearied by the preceding night’s fatigue, had turned
in. Many congratulations passed at meeting again,
with the seamen, as each party knew it had been a
hard night to both. A part of one cable was hauled
in upon the forecastle. The captain informed
me he had lost the best bower, and was resolved to
remain no longer in the river with but one anchor;
he requested me, therefore, to take the remaining
Frenchmen on shore and make for Ensenada by
land or water, as soon as convenient. As the wind
was fair up the river, he should directly weigh and
set sail, stating that if once rid of the troublesome
Frenchmen he had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>The remaining party was soon collected and
seemed unwilling to go on shore through fear of
falling into Portuguese hands. These we likewise
landed on the beach, being all the French passengers.
The ship immediately threw out her sails
and was soon out of sight. Most of these officers
had been troublesome guests, and were discontented,
insolent, and heartily disliked by the ship’s company;
but one of a captain’s rank, was of a different
mould; he was frank and intelligent, fine form and
features, and by his gentlemanly deportment, and
many virtues, had endeared himself throughout the
passage to us Americans. To him, in Spanish, on
stepping on shore, I addressed myself relative to
our situation and prospects. The general with his
servant had left them in the morning to penetrate
his way to Ensenada, as before intended. While<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
speaking to this officer, a quarrel had arisen between
his comrades and the four sailors, which we
endeavored to quell. The captain remonstrated in
vain, and they had proceeded to blows, and the
first party being now joined by the others, were
running for their arms, which hung on the arbor
above, and serious consequences were likely to ensue.
I therefore deemed it prudent to leave them
to their fate, and hastily shook hands with my
friend, and ordered the men to jump into the boat
and pull away. It was instantly done, and we had
gained a considerable distance before our adversaries
had reached the beach. Astonished at this
sudden and unexpected movement, they hallooed
and loaded us with threats and imprecations; but
disregarding all, we laid in our oars, and hoisted a
large lug mainsail, and kept foaming on our way,
the wind being fresh and fair; and shaping our
course for Ensenada, we kept steadily along
the shore, though at a considerable distance from
it, on account of shoals. I had previously been in
the above place four years before, in 1812; I was
well acquainted with the entrance, the several
creeks, and a number of the villagers. In a short
time after our departure with the boat, while sailing
rapidly with a stiff breeze, one of our men discovered
abreast of us, on a pole, a signal of a white
handkerchief, displayed in one of the nooks or windings
of the beach. I directly stood in shore to ascertain
what was meant, and as we neared the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
strand, we discovered to our great surprise, the
party of artizans which we had last landed from
the ship, and who had left us immediately on landing,
to plod their way on foot along shore, to our
place of destination. So great was their eagerness
to reach the boat, that many waded up to their
chins in water, and nearly capsized us in their hurry
to tumble on board. They gave us a direful account
of their progress over the rocks, puddles,
flints, &amp;c. of the beach, having to trudge barefoot,
with their shoes in their hands, as the ground was
so interrupted and broken, that they were often up
mid-deep in water in wading from one point of land
to another. Indeed the contortions of faces, and
lacerated feet, gave strong evidence of very rough
treatment. After a rapid run of about an hour, we
saw the entrance of Ensenada, and by cutting
through a small creek across a point of land, soon
found ourselves in the channel; by the appearance
of the rushes it was nearly high water, and we soon
pulled up along side of a dismantled ship, and saw
several others. I directly ascended on board, but
found no one on deck; on entering the cabin, I saw at
the bottom of the companion way, a foreigner smoking
his cigaro de papel. I inquired in Spanish what
ship, &amp;c. and if the Portuguese were blockading Buenos
Ayres? ‘Nothing like it,’ he answered in Portuguese,
but that they had possession of Monte Video,
and a small squadron there. Highly gratified with
this intelligence, and eased of our apprehensions, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
left her and struck into a small creek which led up
to the village; here we lowered the mainsail, and
took to the oars, as the creeks are here very irregular
and narrow, and we in rowing struck each
bank with our oars. After pulling about a quarter
of a mile, we fell in with a boat with two persons
in the stern, and rowed by two seamen, who, with
the boat, looked like American. I instantly recognised
one of the gentlemen as a Mr. B., who I had
formerly been well acquainted with in Buenos Ayres.
‘Where in the name of wonder, my friend,’ he asked,
‘are you from, with that dismal set of fellows?’
‘From New York,’ I replied. ‘What! in that boat?’
(for he had seen no ship) ‘Oh no! we landed a
score of Frenchmen about four leagues below, for
fear of the Portuguese, and the passengers are
some of them, which we picked up along shore.’
The boats were now alongside together, and my
friend B. introduced me to Captain B., of the ship
A., of Baltimore, then lying in the channel waiting
freight. He advised me to proceed to the captain
of the port, Mr. J., to whose house they were then
going, and report myself. I thought myself fortunate
in falling in, by chance, with such good company,
and on landing, we took the direct path to
the captain of the port’s house. This part of the
country is extremely low and level, insomuch as
two feet above the usual tides would inundate the
country for many miles around. The houses are
thinly scattered, and the people sociable and friendly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
But I shall defer a further description for the
present, and continue the story. To this officer,
the captain of the port, the second in consequence
in the village, and an American, I introduced myself,
and briefly related the occurrences which
brought us into Ensenada; after some conversation,
we proceeded towards the landing place to procure
accommodations for the men, whom I left in the
boat, awaiting my return. In passing by a pulperia,
or small tavern, (where they sell groceries, and can
occasionally supply beds and victuals to the lower
classes) we were soon apprised by their noisy shouts
of mirth, that they were within, regaling themselves
upon the publican’s vino-carlon and sausages, and
congratulating themselves on falling in with so snug
a birth after the stormy nights at sea. The port
officer agreed with the pulpero for the daily supply
and lodgings for the men while we should remain at
Ensenada. From thence we visited the commandant,
who lived about half a mile from the creek.
Here we found a small party of soldiers, through
which we passed, and were ushered into the presence
of the chief magistrate. He appeared to be
about fifty years of age, very corpulent, with a fat,
contented face. After hearing the story, every
thing was in motion. The landing, within his jurisdiction,
of a score of friends from America, was an
important affair, and happened but rarely in this
quiet village, where, in general, the greatest stretch
of his abilities and power consisted in stifling the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
tumultuous rows of the sailors from the ships, on
Sundays, or signing passports for Buenos Ayres.
In conjunction with Mr. J., he procured guides,
horses, riders and carts, to proceed in search of the
abandoned party. As they were officers sent out by
the consul for the patriot army, he wisely considered
they had a claim upon his services and assistance.</p>

<p>The next morning at day break, the caravan of
carts set out from the magistrate’s in quest of the
absent party, with orders to lose no time, but to
proceed till they found them, and to bring them to
his house forthwith. I now took up my abode at
the house of Mr. J., where I remained during my
stay in this place. During the forenoon of the following
day, the carts returned with the wanderers.
They were found in a miserable plight, near a
swamp, from which they had just extricated themselves,
covered with sweat and mud, and nearly exhausted
from fatigue and hunger. They were kept
partially guarded at the commandant’s house till an
answer to his express should arrive from Buenos
Ayres, to which place he had written, relating the
strange manner of their falling into his hands. On
the evening of the third day, the much expected
letters arrived. The captain of the port had instructions
to permit myself and crew to depart at
pleasure, and the commandant had directions to pay
every attention to the French officers, and to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
means to conduct them to Buenos Ayres.
Early the next morning, receiving a passport from
the captain of the port, and a small basket of provisions,
to which we added a jug of wine and keg of
water, we started in our boat, (myself and the four
seamen) for Buenos Ayres. We pulled away at the
oars for about three miles, till we had doubled a
point of land, when we hoisted a sail, and were able,
with the wind, to make a stretch up the river. We
kept wholly along shore, and in about five hours
sail, discerned the merchantmen in the offing of
Buenos Ayres, and passed the English frigate and
native guard brig without molestation. After passing
the small craft in the inner roads to windward,
in a passage of six and a half hours, we landed at
the Mole-Head. This is the only landing place,
saving the custom house, of the port. There are no
piers or wharves, and the shore, or river side, is wholly
occupied by washer-women, who line the whole
surface of the beach, and who, with their black
limbs and snow-white clothes spread around, present
a busy and singular appearance. I procured
lodgings for the men at a house in the street near
the beach, and then went in search of the captain,
who I presumed was ashore, as we had seen the
ship in the outer roads; but he had not yet landed.
In the afternoon, however, I fell in with him near
the Mole, having just landed. In the morning a
pilot was procured and we went on board; and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
day the ship, after losing her long boat, which filled
and swamped while under way, and broke her fast,
was brought in to an anchor in the inner roads.</p>

<p>On the twenty second of February, Washington’s
birth day, a phenomenon took place at Buenos
Ayres, which will ever be remembered by those
who witnessed it, and which I believe has never
been recorded. On the morning of that day, while
lying off from the shore about three quarters of a
mile—the men being employed, as usual, in washing
the decks, being about half past seven, and the sun
two hours high—‘Jack,’ says one of the men to his
shipmate, after he had thrown his bucket of water,
and was observing the weather, ‘what means that
cloud of dust in the wake of the town, yonder?’
Before the question could be answered by his comrade,
however, the uncommon appearance of this
dense body of dust, and the wild appearance of the
sky, had rivetted the eyes of all on board. ‘Stand
by the cable tier!’ vociferated the chief mate; ‘jump
down and be ready to pay out—bear a hand, my
hearties, here’s a pampero coming, driving the
world before him.’ The black cloud of dust now
rising and expanding in awful grandeur, and extending
over half the horizon, rapidly approached
us, immediately followed by an immense shroud of
impenetrable darkness, which rose beneath and followed
it. As the ship lay broadside to the shore,
I was proceeding from midships to the helm, in
order to bring her head to wind; but I was arrested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
in my progress by total darkness and the tremendous
blast, which at once, struck the ship and
nearly capsized her, and had to secure myself by
clenching the railing. This is indeed a phenomenon,
I exclaimed to the chief mate; what comes next?
but astonishment kept him and all others deprived,
for the time, of speech. Here, for a few moments,
was a grand and awfully sublime spectacle; on one
side of us was a body of almost palpable darkness,
and on the other, the fair light of heaven. Expecting
momently to be blown to the other regions, we
waited, breathlessly, the result of this wonder of
nature for about twenty minutes, when the field of
darkness passed through, and was driven beyond us
to the other side, and in its vacancy the light slowly
returned; thus we had repeatedly light on one side
and darkness on the other. On discerning the features
of each other, we were surprised at their
ludicrous complexion; a sooty black dust had overspread
our faces, and rendered our appearance like
that of negroes. On recovering from our surprise,
we found we had sustained no other damage than
dragging our anchors a few cables length; but other
vessels, near us before, we scarcely could recognise,
they had drifted so far. The remainder of the day
was boisterous and rainy, attended with heavy
thunder and lightning. The sailors considered this
event as a voice of Providence, and the carpenter
piously believed it a judgment on the sinful inhabitants
of the land. In the city, a greater degree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
consternation prevailed. Many, at the time, were
in the streets, going and returning from market;
but the sudden absence of light compelled every one
to remain as he was caught, with caravans of mules,
droves of horses, &amp;c., while milk boys, priests and
begging friars, dropped on their knees and earnestly
implored the protection of the saints.</p>

<p>In April, the ship having altered her destination,
I obtained a release, not choosing to return home,
and desirous of seeing more of the world. Soon
after, meeting with an old acquaintance, a sea captain,
he proposed to me a birth in a good ship, soon
to sail to Valparaiso, in the Pacific, doubling Cape
Horn, and from thence westwardly to Canton, and
returning by the way of the Cape of Good Hope,
thus completing the circumnavigation of the globe,
or the sailing round the world. This was just what
I wished, and which would occupy, probably, twenty
or twenty four months. While making preparations,
however, news arrived from the Pacific,
detrimental to the sale of the cargo they were receiving
on board, which was matte or yerba, (Paraguay
tea) which they were obliged to discharge;
and much to my mortification the voyage was altered.
In the month of May, however, I entered
as second officer on board of this ship, the Jane,
Captain William Seaboth, bound to Brazil, with a
cargo of hides. Our departure was sometime retarded
by striking on the bar, in going out, which
damaged our rudder and detained us nearly six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
weeks. Towards the middle of June, however, we
again set sail, and after a pleasant passage of twenty
days, came to anchor in the harbor of Rio Janeiro.
Here we had to remain nearly two months,
for freight. We succeeded at last in procuring it,
consisting of nearly two hundred pipes of wine,
several hundred barrels of flour, tobacco in baskets,
crockery ware, dry goods, salmon and Irish butter
in kegs, salchina, or salt pork, which is the side
of a hog rolled up hard and put in a basket of the
shape of a meal bag, &amp;c. &amp;c.; a very full cargo.
We had on board five passengers, two of them
Spaniards, a German, an Englishman and an American,
as follows: Senior Monasteria, an eminent
engineer, whose wife and four children were living
in Buenos Ayres, of which he was a valuable citizen,
aged about forty five; Senior Barras, a resident of
Rio, of a weak constitution, who had undertaken
this passage on account of his low state of health,
and about twenty years of age. On the day of our
departure from Rio, his father, an aged Spaniard,
who resided there, came on board to see that every
thing was prepared for his comfort, and to take a
farewell of his only son. Mynheer Mann, a German
gentleman, who had been for some years a
resident of Rio Janeiro, and had before freighted
vessels and taken passage in them from thence to
Monte Video; he was a man of middle age, of prepossessing
appearance, a gentleman and a scholar,
and possessing the milk of human kindness in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
eminent degree. Francis Summers, a North Briton,
aged about thirty, who had likewise long resided in
Buenos Ayres, Monte Video, and Rio Janeiro, and
had many acquaintances in all those places; he was
strong and athletic, of enterprising habits, and his
loss was deeply lamented. Lastly, Mr. Tiernay,
an American, (naturalized) who, I believe, was a
native of France, the language of which he spoke
with ease; he was a large and well proportioned
man, of great information, and easy and sociable
manners. He had left Baltimore about a year previous,
with a freight, which he advantageously disposed
of at Rio, and on the arrival of the Union,
Captain P., of Boston, purchased about four hundred
barrels of flour and put on board of our vessel,
which would have brought a great price at Monte
Video had our ship reached the port.</p>

<p>Our captain was by birth a Dane, a large and corpulent
man, a perpetual smoker, a great eater,
drank nothing but water, talked but little and played
admirably upon the piano forte, having one in
his state room. He was a man of a most phlegmatic
and easy temper, upon which fair weather or foul,
bad luck or good, could make no perceptible impression.
The slaves were freshly imported, untamed
sons of Angola; the seamen, (Swedes and
Englishmen) much like all other sailors, careless,
illiterate, rough and honest. We were plentifully
stocked with provisions and liquors of all kinds,
such as wine, oranges, poultry, pigs, two goats for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
milking, three monkies for mischief, a dog, a cat,
and about twenty parrots and paraquitos. Thus
comfortably provided, in the morning of the third
of September, 1817, we were wafted out of the
harbor by a cheering breeze from the land, in company
with six or eight sail of large Portuguese Indiamen,
two English ships for Lima, an English
schooner for Monte Video, and an American ship
(the Diomede, of Salem, Captain Page) for Buenos
Ayres, and several coasting sumacos.</p>

<p>The view of this part of the Coast of Brazil, near
the entrance of this harbor is, perhaps, no where
surpassed in point of majestic grandeur and beauty.
The cloud capp’t—but of this in another place.
Nothing of consequence occurred during the passage,
till within about fifty leagues of the mouth of
the La Plata. About ten, A. M., on the fourteenth
of September, a man at work aloft arrested the
dull, monotonous sounds of the winds and waves,
by the cry of sail ho! It was the first time we had
heard that ever welcome exclamation, and we were
eager now to approach and hail the supposed vessel.
The helmsman was directed to keep in a direct
course for the sail. With a stiff breeze and
fair wind we rapidly neared it, when it began to
assume a different appearance—the sails and masts
were no longer visible. The hull, however, was still
plainly seen, and looked like the wreck of some
large vessel, and some, by the help of glasses, affirmed
they could distinctly perceive her broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
timbers. This was the general belief, nor were we
undeceived till we were within hail of it, when the
supposed hull of a foundered frigate, proved to be
but the wreck of a prodigious South Atlantic whale!
From his appearance, he had been dead a long
while; he had opened, on the upper surface, his
whole length, and presented an immense yawning
breach, on each side of which, appeared his large
ribs and bones. He lay in an inclined position,
which prevented the swelling surge from entering
and filling him, though it would dash in a foam
around him; this gave him, even at a moderate distance,
the appearance of a large wreck. A vast
number of sea birds had alighted upon him, and
with large shoals of various fish, were eagerly assisting
to devour him.</p>

<p>The next day we fell in with and spoke the English
brig Mary, from Liverpool, bound to Buenos
Ayres, seventy three days out. It being about meridian,
with fair weather and smooth sea, we gave
the captain an invitation to dine with us, which he
accepted; and, accordingly, we backed topsails and
lay too, the brig doing the same, when we lowered
the boat from the stern, conducted him on board
of us, hoisted up the boat, filled the sails again and
then bore away. This commander was dressed, as
English captains frequently are at sea, in a check
shirt, short jacket, leather cap, and tarry trowsers.
A novice could not have distinguished him from one
of his crew; he was, however, sociable and friendly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
had brought a fine large Cheshire cheese with him,
and took in return a half dozen of wine. The next
day we lost sight of him, he being light and a faster
sailer. The morning was rather hazy when we entered
the river, which we knew we were in, by the
changed color of the water. The land was soon
plainly seen, stretching low from Cape St. Mary
up the river, with the sandy beaches, trees, and
hills. We passed Lobos, or Seal Island, about nine,
A. M. These seals or sea wolves appeared at this
time in greater numbers here, than I had ever seen
them. We passed Moldonado, a small town, about
eleven—continuing our course up the river with a
light but fair wind, till towards sunset, when the
fog still becoming more dense, the wind increasing
and night approaching, it was determined to haul
off shore for several miles, and thus gain an offing
for anchorage during the night. We accordingly
came to anchor about fifteen miles below Monte
Video, our first destined port to the leeward of
Flores, or Isle of Flowers—the wind now blowing
fresh from the south east. At eight o’clock, the
gale increasing very fast, we payed out a long scope
of cable, and she seemed for the present to ride
easy, and with much less straining. Between this
time and nine o’clock, while supper was preparing
below, and the crew in the forecastle, the captain
and myself, with his inseparable solace, a cigar,
were walking the quarter deck, balancing ourselves
to the roll and plunges and lurches of the vessel;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
conversing upon the events of the passage, the
character of our passengers, and on the happy prospects
of breakfasting next morning in Monte Video.
In concluding the conversation, Captain S., after
looking around upon the portentous sky and troubled
waves, made the following memorable observation.
‘But keep a good look out to-night, Mr. F.,
and tend well the cable, for if we drive ashore here,
we are all lost.’ We then descended the cabin,
giving charge to the watch, and sat down with light
and still happy hearts, to supper. Happy were
we all in the idea of being so near the end of our
voyage—but how unconscious that the supper we
partook of, was the last to be taken, and that six
brief hours should end the voyage of life with all,
save one. Little, for my own part, did I dream of
or presage its sad reality. I had formed plans,
which, on shore with my adventurers, were brilliant
in prospective, and I indulged in pleasing reveries.
After the removal of the cloth, wine was passed
around, and the cabin at this time presented a
group of happy and expecting mortals, who, after
the dangers of the ocean, and almost in hail of their
homes, were congratulating themselves upon the fair
prospect of the pleasures before them.</p>

<p>I ascended on deck, to observe the weather before
I turned in. The gale still continued to increase—the
ship pitching very heavily, plunging
bows under, and wet from fore to aft by the sea
and the spray. After seeing all snug, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the deck in charge of the officer of the watch, I
descended, and turned into my hammock, stripping
off only my outer great jacket. At twelve, midnight,
after passing a sleepless and anxious watch
below, with sensations as strange and uneasy as the
laboring motions of the ship, I came upon deck to
relieve the watch. I went forward and examined
the cables at the hawse holes, to see if the canvas
or service needed renewing from the chafing; and
seeing all was well, I returned to the quarter deck,
to the lead line. The watch which had been relieved,
had retired and turned in, and myself, boatswain
and four men, remained as the watch on deck.
The ship was rolling and pitching most laborsome,
as the weather current was very strong. ‘An uncomfortable
night this, sir,’ said the boatswain, who
was a great talker, ‘and infernal cold for a warm
country—faith, I must button up my monkey, and
secure my tarpaulin, if we are to stand this weather
here on deck for four hours. Whew! this is a
snorter; and we must keep well aft, or else a sea
from over the bows there, will throw us off our legs,
or a spray give us a drencher to freshen our eyelids.
D—n her, how she jumps and pitches; well,
for my part, give me a ship under sail, with the
wind a-beam to steady her, instead of lying here at
anchor, where she tumbles about like a chip in a
frog pond.’ The moon was now about half an hour
high. From the feeling of the lead, I was fearful
that the ship had been, and was still fast drifting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
The motion of the vessel and strong current, prevented
my knowing this to a certainty—while at
the line, I observed an unusual white foam to the
leeward, and remarked it to the boatswain. He
replied, he thought it no more than the curling tops
of the waves. Not satisfied with this, I went aft
into the yawl over the stern, and was soon convinced
they were that dread of sailors, breakers, and
not far from us. I quickly went below, and awoke
the captain, who was in a secure and profound sleep!
by violently shaking him; and with a loud cry of
‘breakers!’ aroused the passengers. I then went
forward to get ready another anchor, and several
men were clearing the cable tier below. The captain
had just gained the deck, when, at quarter past
twelve, the vessel struck. The shock sunk upon
the hearts of those on board, like the summons for
sudden death—and with reason. All knew that
while the ship rode clear of the ground, they were
in safety; but the moment she struck, their minutes
were numbered, and death inevitable. Those
below were directly alarmed by the shock, and hurried
affrighted to the deck. Another blow soon followed—then
another, and another, still more heavy.
A heavy sea soon struck over the bows, and knocked
down several seamen, and obliged them to retreat
to the quarter deck. The seas began now to break
over the whole weather side, and all were palsied
with horror on looking around at the awful, prospect—the
tremendous surge, and the fate which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
could not be shunned. The passengers and seamen
had all reached the deck, excepting the carpenter,
who lay sick in his hammock in the steerage—some,
in nothing but their shirts, and all half dressed, or
with some clothes in their hands. On seeing their
perilous situation, the clothes were dropped, and
they secured their hold to the rigging—the ship
continually striking. The captain ordered the steward
to secure some articles in the cabin; he descended,
but soon came up with the dismal tidings that
every thing was adrift and the cabin full of water.
‘Cut away the masts! cut away the masts!’ he then
cried out. I went forward to the carpenter’s chest;
I asked several for the axe. ‘We don’t know of any
axe, sir,’ was the answer. ‘Lord have mercy upon
us.’ The seas now forced all to secure their holds.
Young Summers had gained the weather main
shrouds, nearly naked and drenched by every sea.
‘Fracker, where are you,’ he exclaimed, in a voice
of despair. ‘Here am I, Frank,’ I replied, holding
on with the rest—‘God only can help us now.’ One
sailor alone, delirious with horror that stupified
others, was loud in his cries of despair. Irritated
at such cowardice in one who had been a bullying,
boisterous fellow, I told him hastily to stop his
clamors, and not thus to discourage others; that if
he wished to save himself, it must be by exertion,
and not lamentation; and that the ship could, possibly,
hold together till day-light. But the others
stood inanimate; and despair and horror at their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
inevitable fate, deprived them of all motion, speech
or sensation of danger. The seas at this time were
making complete cataracts over every part of the
ship, and perceiving I should soon have to commit
myself to the waves, I threw off my pea jacket and
hat into the sea. Most of the crew and passengers
were holding firmly on the different parts of the
quarter deck, and three or four naked, shivering
wretches, had ventured partly up the shrouds, clinging
with ghastly looks to the ropes, as their last
hold, from which the merciless waves were tearing
them in succession, and they were instantly overwhelmed
and buried in their bosoms.</p>

<p>From the time she had first struck, the sea had
so completely burst over us, that it rendered every
effort of endeavoring to help ourselves, useless and
dangerous—in our first intentions of cutting the cables,
making some sail, or, at the worst, to cut
away the masts, and driving as fast as possible on
shore. Such, indeed, was its sudden violence, that
nothing was soon thought of but to attempt to hold
on as long as possible, and all other efforts were impracticable
and abandoned. Ten or twelve of us,
at this time, were holding on to the weather quarter
rail; every sea, a solid body of water, to which
at its approach we presented our bare heads, would
immediately wash us off our legs horizontally, at
arm’s length, and the comrade at my side, with several
others, were torn from their grasp, and hurled
and buried amid the wreck and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>Finding it impossible to stand this suffocating
drenching any longer, and my arms weak from such
powerful stretching, I watched my chance, after a
prodigious surge roared over me, loosed my hold,
seized the mizen backstay, climbed over the heads
of some who were clinging to the rigging, and happily
gained the mizen top, advising the rest to follow,
as I was certain no man could stand the force
of such terrific seas five minutes longer. Here, in
the mizen top, in the interval of the ship’s striking,
I fell to thrashing myself, and preparing for the
waves. My body and limbs had become much benumbed,
from the severe drenching below, and my
feet were entirely without feeling. I took off my
shoes and began to beat the soles of my feet with
them; by which means, and by violently thrashing
my body with my arms, I succeeded, at last, in circulating
the blood, and rendering myself once more
warm. While aloft, I drew out my knife and cut
away the gaskets which confined the mizen topsail,
wishing, by this, to drive her further towards the
shore, which I could not yet discover. I also succeeded
in cutting away several of the lanyards of
the topmast rigging, hoping that the topmast might
go over and leave the mizenmast standing till the
last, to hold on to; but this was unavailing, as the
keel having been beat off, the masts ultimately
gave way in the steps.</p>

<p>I looked down below, and beheld, with varied
emotions, and not without a degree of painful pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
a shipwreck, in which the fearful and the
sublime were strongly blended. It was a sight from
which I could not wish to avert my eyes, though I
would have given worlds, at the same moment, for
a foothold of safety. Holding on to the topmast
rigging, and bending over the top, I watched, with
straining eyes, the scene of death and destruction,
so busily and clamorously carried on beneath me.
Of those whom I had left grasping the quarter rail,
I saw the three last washed from their holds, who
soon met death. The mainmast having topgallant
yard across, likewise fell over the side, and unluckily
the wrong side, being to windward, off shore,
which I was sorry to see, the ship laying broadside
to the waves, and heeled much to windward. The
moon had not yet set, and though obscured, enabled
me to see, distinctly, the dire effects of the
tempest. The long boat was forced from her head
gripes and fastenings, and forced round, end on, to
the sea; a second wave struck her stern, and instantly
her fragments and contents were thrown
beyond me, and the small boat, astern, instantly
after, followed, borne on the top of a sea, with all
her appendage of davils, tackles and lashings. The
foremast, I imagined, would now speedily fall, as
from its rolling I supposed its step was gone, as the
ship beat heaviest at the fore part; but on the contrary,
I soon found myself going over with the
mizen mast, which fell and carried me along with it.
I was plunged into the sea, and received a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
scratches and bruises, but happily extricated myself
from beneath the ropes, got round the top, and
crawling down by the upper rigging, with difficulty
regained the ship.</p>

<p>I was now beset on all sides with conflicting timber,
but was happily well aware of the danger that
threatened me. I found every plank of the main
deck washed off and in pieces—the bulwarks stripped
and gone fore and aft, and pipes of wine, tierces,
barrels of flour and kegs of butter, hencoops,
crates and spars, added to the general wreck. In
jumping from the rail to gain the lee side, I fell
among this ruin, but had hitherto felt only one or
two severe bruises. A tremendous wave now broke
over the quarter, and sweeping every thing before,
carried me along with some large spars forward,
when my right leg was struck by one of them, and
jambed in between that and a deck beam, at the
joint of the knee, which was instantly crushed, and
held as in a vice, immoveable. My situation was
now for two minutes most critical, and frightfully
dismaying—another sea was roaring towards me.
The blow I received had almost severed my limb,
though I felt no pain. The next minute the surrounding
timber would infallibly be washed in a
storm around my head and body, and I momently
expected it. By a providential rise of the water,
I was enabled to catch hold of the lee rail, screwed
out my leg, dodged under the rail, tumbled into the
sea, and the wave roared harmless over my head!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
I did this, not in the hope of reaching the shore, for
I thought, indeed, it was not within many miles;
but resolving to hasten my end, and preferring to
die in the open sea, and especially to avoid a death
by piecemeal—by crushing now and then a joint or
a limb. I had heard the groans of two or three
others, and among them, the voice of the commander;
their bones, probably, mostly broken, who had
escaped being carried off by the waves, and who
were, I presumed, but just alive. These, I believed,
were all that still remained of this ill-fated company.
After I had plunged into the sea, and rose, I
held on, for a moment, to the upper timbers, which
were all that was left of the ship, and those loosening,
to recover breath. I soon quitted and began
to strip, which was a difficult operation for a person
in my then situation, as my leg hung down, like a
rope, useless in the water, and I had on a thick
jacket, two pair of duck trowsers, and neckerchief,
a black Barcelona. While effecting this, some one,
(and the only one I discovered) clinging to the timbers,
was suddenly washed from his hold, and extending
his arms, his right hand came in contact
with my neckerchief, which he convulsively grasped,
and we sunk together! Pushed for breath myself,
it was no time for ceremony—the next hold I perhaps
could not disengage, and an attempt to assist
him would only ensure certain death to both; I
therefore quickly pulled the end of my neckerchief,
the knot being fortunately with a bow, and he sunk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
with it in his hand, and the waves closed over him
forever. I presumed he was a passenger, from his
white shirt, and from his stout appearance, the
Senior Monasteria or Mr. Tiernay. While under
water, I in a moment stripped, and again rose to
the surface, divested of all covering but my shirt.
My leg, I felt, was powerless, and in stripping off
my trowsers, the twisting of it gave a degree of
pain, besides which, I had several scratches and
bruises; through these, the chilling coldness of the
water struck to the heart.</p>

<p>When a boy, I was an expert swimmer; and when
arrived at manhood, could jump from the gunwale
of a ship, fully clad, strip while doubling the keel,
and come up the other side with my clothes under
my arm. No one that I had met with, possessed
the faculty of retaining breath, and withholding
the respiration for so long a period. But in this
case, swimming, even with able and untired limbs,
was wholly useless in a sea so heavy; and efforts to
keep my head above water was all I could hope for.
The moon had now gone down, and committing
myself to God, I then pushed off from the wreck,
to be thrown by the surge where his providence
should impel. With two arms and a leg, I kept before
the wind, and every sea would wash far over
my head; I resolved, therefore, to seize hold of the
first large substance I should encounter, and gain
breath, of which I was very short. I soon fastened
upon a bale of goods, but it being wet and heavy, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
relinquished it, as every sea rolled over it, and I
quitted it nearly exhausted. I saw numberless pieces
of the wreck, and was in constant danger of
being struck by some, which I repeatedly avoided
by paddling from and diving, which the prodigious
seas wholly overwhelmed. I stood this hard buffeting
for about a dozen seas, and nature was fast retreating
from the conflict, being desperately pushed for
breath, as I could draw but little in the short intervals
of the waves. I had now been nearly half an
hour in the water, and nearly half the time below it;
I had withstood, beyond my hopes, this war of elements,
but my breath now became harder and
quicker—I felt a suffocation and strangling—I turned
and faced the waves in despair—I gasped twice,
with a convulsive leap—another sea swept over me—I
saw death inevitable, terrible, and face to face!
I had but time, involuntarily, but audibly, to repeat
the ejaculation, ‘Lord Jesus receive my spirit,’ and
sunk in unshaken faith, that till the last trump
should summon all hands, I should rise no more!
My senses with my breath, also forsook me; and
for a moment my mind was filled with the most
singular and delightful sensations, apparently in an
enrapturing dream. This, however, was as momentary
as it was wonderful. I cannot imagine by
what means, whether from the chill of the water,
the pain of my wounds, or by the violence of a wave
that then broke over me, but I was soon brought to
my senses, and rose to the surface evidently refreshed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Thy hand, O God, was here! On looking
around, I distinctly discovered, as if supernaturally
thrown in my way, something large and light, for
it kept constantly above the waves. I exerted my
remaining strength, and reached it; it was a large
crate, empty of all but straw. Into this, I firmly
clenched my fingers, and soon recovered breath, as
its buoyancy kept it high above the seas. Five
minutes of this eventful night, I never think of but
with sentiments of amazement and gratitude.—While
in the act of sinking, as I supposed, for the
last time, the crowd of recollections, and the rapid
succession of thoughts thronged my brain almost
to bursting, I, who two hours before, was in health,
happiness and security, now found myself in the
midst of darkness, danger and death, encompassed
with the merciless element, without a gleam of hope,
and momently expecting to enter that unknown
world, ‘with all my imperfections on my head.’ The
crate to which I had so fortunately attached myself,
I have reason to believe, was the only thing,
by the assistance of which, I could save my life.
Keeping my hold of this, and constantly turning
it round as my weight pulled it over towards me, I
still kept courage, and dropped myself frequently
down under water as far as I could stretch at arm’s
length, without quitting my hold, with the earnest
hope of touching the bottom, but without success.
I was much fatigued from exertion and anxiety,
and could scarcely continue my hold upon the crate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
for every sea would sweep us at least ten feet before
it, and I began to despair of any land being
near, and was fearful that the ship had been wrecked
upon a shoal; still, however, holding on the crate,
as I felt it my only hope, and knew if I lost that I
was lost indeed! Drifting along with hopeless indifference,
I was beginning to droop in despair; and
overcome with exertion, I felt a lethargy creeping
over me, and resolved, with a last effort, to arouse
my drowsy spirits, and by violently shaking the
crate, shook myself, and looking around, I was surprised
and animated, to find an uncommon lull and
subsiding of the swelling surge—I was once more
alive, for I was inside the breakers! I again quickly
dropped myself down, eagerly stretching my
limbs to the utmost length, and with my toe touched
the bottom! I felt it was of sand, and in a few
minutes more I got up to about breast high in the
water, and shoving myself forward by leg and arms,
soon crawled out of the surf upon the beach.</p>

<p>Thus, after being more than half an hour in the
water, and making my way for nearly three quarters
of a mile, through a raging sea, at midnight, I
was at last thrown upon a desert beach, certain
that no one could have reached a cable’s length
from the ship, which in an hour and a half after she
first struck, was scattered in pieces on the strand.
Some idea may be had of the violence of the elements,
from the fact that not a single mast came
on shore unbroken, nor a timber as big as the windlass;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
and out of twenty three souls, among whom
were four stout African slaves, whose constant
habit of swimming renders them almost amphibious,
only one body was thrown on shore that night;
the remainder, buried by the first wave, came not
on shore till nine days afterwards.</p>

<p>Amazed and nearly stunned, on reaching the
beach, I attempted, unconsciously, to stand, but
my leg refused its office, and I fell backwards to the
ground and was much hurt by the fall, which caused
the blood to ooze from several wounds. Half frantic
with pain and the severe chill of the weather, a
groan, as I lay extended on the earth, for once escaped
me. I groaned and wished for death; I could
then, I believe, have met him without fear—not as
the king of terrors, but the messenger of mercy; I
considered the fate of my companions happier far
than my own, for their sufferings, though severe,
were momentary, while mine, perhaps, were to be
protracted, till struggling nature, slowly giving way,
sunk under misery at its utmost stretch. Torments
so acute I determined not to endure; the dreaded
alternative was therefore soon chosen, and I resolved
to put an end to my existence by the first
means chance should throw in my power. I had
many reasons to urge me to this desperate act. The
country around me, I believed from experience on
the opposite shore, was barren and desolate, without
inhabitants for a great distance, impenetrable from
swamps and shrubbery, with no chance of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
discovered; the cold was to my body deadly and
fearful, and not being able to move without torture,
I should not certainly, unsheltered, survive till the
morning. The moon had set long since, and I was
now in almost palpable darkness, and I could have
seen no object, though my eyelids brushed it.
Raising myself up at last, I slowly drew myself out
of the surf, by hitching myself backwards. I was
seated on the sand, with my hand groping around
me, and felt hoops, or something bulky, and found,
to my surprise, a pipe of wine. I had not left
the ship too soon, for here was the lowest tier
of the cargo on shore before me. Impelled by pain
and despair, I was several times on the point of
knocking my head against it and dashing out my
brains, but as often hesitated, doubting only my
strength to give one sufficient blow. A sad dilemma—but
God was with me. A second thought most
happily struck me; the cask was large, and sufficient
to contain me, if I could possibly stave in the
head, and lying end to the wind, would prove a
complete shelter from the dreaded cold.</p>

<p>Thus it pleased Providence, that the intended
instrument of death, should be the very means of
my preservation! Hope once more brightened and
gave me triple vigor. Groping still farther along,
I felt, for I truly could see nothing about me, several
sticks of heavy Brazil wood, dunnage to the
pipes, and taking up one, I got round to the upper
head, and by repeated strokes, made a breach and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
broke, with strength that surprised me, the middle
head stave. The wine burst out, I applied my
mouth and drank some of it, and then continued
my strokes with renewed force. A few more blows
stove the head at last entirely in; the wine burst
over me, the touch of which, to my frozen carcase,
was electric and most agreeable. I took up two
pieces of the head staves and placed them in the
bottom or bilge of the cask, to make it even and
level, and then crawled in. The interior felt to my
body like an oven. I had, during all this time, been
at work partly in the water, at the edge of the surf,
which now flowed in upon me at every wave, and
kept me constantly throwing it out with my left
hand, as I lay in the water on my back as the least
painful position. This labor I was obliged to continue
the remainder of the night, till towards morning;
when the wind somewhat abated, the tide
ebbed, and the surf retreating, no longer kept me
bailing; I was, however, too exhausted to remove.
At day break I looked out of the cask, and beheld
a long sandy beach, covered to a great extent on
each side of me with the fragments of the wreck,
but not a vestige of the ship as long as the pump,
or any thing moving, excepting the gulls. In fact, I
was assured, on first reaching the shore, that no
mortal alone could make his way through such seas,
in such a night, to the land. My own preservation
I considered as little short of a miracle. A shipwreck
so sudden, an escape so singular, the uproar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
I had witnessed, and the sight now before me, my
scattered senses could scarce conceive real. For
some time I actually doubted myself awake, for it
seemed like a horrible dream. I then again composed
myself in the cask, and owing to pain, the
fumes of the wine and great exertion, I remained,
during the whole of this day, nearly insensible, and
in a trance-like stupor. Towards sunset I was fearful
of being carried away by the return of the tide,
during the approaching night, with the pipe in this
dangerous situation; I therefore reluctantly crawled
out of the cask, and holding up my useless leg from
trailing on the ground, and hitching myself backward
with my right hand, gained at last the foot of
a sand hill further up the beach. I worked myself
up on this as high as my strength would permit, to
be free from the reach of the sea; and as night was
now darkening around, I looked anxiously and in
vain, for some kind of hole into which to crawl.
Finding no refuge above ground, I was constrained
to seek one below it. With a heavy heart, I dug a
bed in the sand, into which I crept, and with my
lacerated leg undermost, raking the sand over me,
laid down, expecting only to rise ‘when the last
trump should rouse me with its warning.’ The
sand and my shirt were my only covering; the
weather was extremely cold, and during the night
it rained and stormed as hard as ever. The wet
sand drifting around in smothering showers, covered
every part of me, filling at every blast, my hair,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
eyes, nose and mouth, kept me constantly spitting
it out to prevent suffocation, while the cold often
compelled me to sit up and thrash myself to prevent
the chill of death. About midnight, in hopes of
better avoiding the wintry wind, I resolved to shift
my position, and try to get under the lee, or into
some hollow on the other side of the hill. I accordingly
crawled some distance, I knew not wither,
owing to extreme darkness, and made another hole;
then thrashing my arms for some time, again ventured
to lay down, covering myself, as before, with
sand, to resist the cold. Such was my bed, and
such the manner in which I passed another night,
and stood the ‘pelting of the pitiless storm.’</p>

<p>In the morning I looked around and observed I
had got over to the other side of the hillock, in
sight of a low, marshy country, intermixed with low
shrubbery, but saw no sign of habitation or cattle.
I then took a survey of myself, and I truly looked
like nothing human, or in the likeness of any thing
upon earth or the waters beneath. My wounds
were filled with sand, as were also my eyebrows,
hair, beard and whiskers; my leg swelled to the
plumpness of a wool sack, my left wrist out of joint,
and the hand swelled and wholly useless; my feet
were swelled and wrinkled like tripe, from remaining
so long in the water, and painful from several
wounds;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and a ragged shirt, torn in my struggles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
scantily covered a body discolored and sadly disfigured;
I was, indeed, a figure too shocking even
to excite pity, too disabled to excite fear, and too
monstrous for any sensation but astonishment. I
descended the slope of the hill and entered among
the bushes that grew around, and slowly moved
along for some time, till I espied at some distance,
through the grass, a low hollow, that I thought
might contain water, for my thirst was intolerable.
In half an hour, resting at intervals, I reached it,
and found, to my great joy, that I was not deceived;
it was water! clear and tempting; but the difficulty
was to get at it. I at first tried several different plans
to get my mouth to the brook, for my limbs were
too lame and stiff to bend. At last, by laying at
length on the grass and rolling up to it, I succeeded.
It was the most delicious draught I ever tasted!
I drank an immoderate quantity, breathed awhile,
and drank once more, not knowing when I should
drink again. Looking about me, I saw nothing but
what indicated a barren and inhospitable waste; I
was therefore compelled to wend my way over the
sand, and return to my old abode; a tedious and
difficult task, which, however, I surmounted, and
reached the beach about noon. The weather was
still inauspicious and cloudy, the gale not much
abated, and the sea continued to roar.</p>

<p>While descending the slope, I had seen among
the great mass of articles on the beach, a large
empty wine pipe, which lay but a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
below me, with one head stove in by the sea, the
other end facing the wind and water, and the mouth
near the hill, which was a snug shelter in front.
This was a fine house for me, and fortunately just
what I needed. I hitched myself towards it, entered
it and laid down, being very weak and fatigued;
but I soon found the rough staves too hard for my
bare bones and bruised carcase. I shortly after
sallied out in search of a covering, and in hopes of
finding some bed, mattress or blanket among the
wreck, I took a survey on each side, and saw at a
distance, on my right, something that looked like a
bed, but on coming up to it, I found only a sack of
cotton wool, wet and heavy, which I could not remove;
I then returned to the cask, having reluctantly
left it, as it was my only hope. I rested
awhile, and then took another survey, and soon saw,
at a great distance down the beach, on my left,
towards the water, some rolls of cotton bagging, of
which we had a great number on board, and again
started out in pursuit. I was a long time in getting
to them, and then found them so buried in the sand
that I was an hour in digging and clearing it away
from around them. It was now, I judged, about
four, P. M. They were two large rolls, like bed
ticking, with about twenty yards of one rolled round
the other and sewed. I tore away the stitches with
my teeth and unrolled one from the other, and found
the inner one still wet. I pushed it down and rolled
it along before me, hitching myself up to it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
then pushing it from me again. Thus I got it to
the cask and across its mouth; getting into which,
I unrolled eight or ten fathoms, then laying down
in the cask, pushed and spread it as well as I could
underneath me; I then unrolled as much more by
the help of my feet, and covered myself with it,
though it was still wet, and covered, as was every
thing else, with sand. I now thought myself very
well off, and my situation very comfortable, compared
with that of the last thirty hours. Darkness
soon came on, and during this night extreme and
raging thirst kept me awake, and pain kept me
constantly shifting positions. Such to me appeared
the endless duration of the night, that for many
hours before day-break, I firmly believed, and was
greatly alarmed by the apprehension, that light
would never again revisit the earth; and that darkness
had regained its primeval empire. I watched
away the night in insufferable thirst, which I thought
would drive me to distraction; a fever was raging
within me, and I would have given my all for one
poor draught of water. Daylight, at last, slowly
dawned forth, and as my limbs were too feeble to
undertake a journey to the watering place, I resolved
to break in upon the wine, and to search for
a pipe that had its bung inclining downwards, that
the wine might flow, if I could hammer it out.
My hunger, too, was loudly craving; on my way to
the wine, I found an orange broken open and filled
with sand, which I greedily devoured, and hitched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
along; soon after, I fell in with a quantity of kegs
of salmon, and found one with the head out, and
partly filled with sand; nevertheless, I resolved to
take it with me, and fill it with wine. I was in fact
surrounded at this place with different parts of the
cargo. At a short distance from me, strewed upon
the beach, were nearly 150 pipes of wine, kegs of
butter, barrels of flour, baskets of pork, bales of
goods, &amp;c., different fragments of the wreck without
number. In passing the kegs of butter and
baskets of pork, my hunger compelled me to claw
out a handful of each, which my hunger forced down;
but the wine which I afterwards drank, soon threw
it out again. Coming to the pipes, I found one
that answered, and procuring a billet of wood,
struck out the bung of one that inclined downward,
and applied my mouth to the hole, drinking a great
quantity. I afterwards rinced the keg with the
wine, which contained about a gallon; and nearly
filling it with wine, returned with it slowly to the
cask, pushing it before me. The gulls overhead,
were noisy and clamorous, and seemed to anticipate
the meal they should make of me. This keg I at
last brought to the cask, to my great satisfaction;
set it outside, crawled in, and began to ruminate
upon my condition. I found it would be impossible,
without succor, to move much longer about, and
determined to remain at home during the remainder
of the day; and if sufficient strength remained
on the morrow, to rig a kind of signal, with a pole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
or spar, as my only chance of relief, with a piece
of cotton bagging, for a flag, that if any vessel appeared
near enough, she might observe it from the
river. I at first had serious thoughts of endeavoring
to get off the small boat, which I could discover
at a great distance, bottom up, and to rig a kind
of sail, and steer up the river; but on looking at
my limbs, and having but one leg and arm serviceable,
I immediately abandoned the project; I knew
too, that my time was short; I knew that the next
day I should be unable to make a farther search
than I had done for provisions, as the method of
getting along was slow and painful; I had frequently
to stop and thrash myself, from the cold. Added
to this, nothing was more probable than that the
first savage who should discover me, would instantly
despatch me, as an impediment to plunder. I expected
no less, and that my fears were not groundless,
the sequel too mournfully shows; but a certain
presentiment of brighter hours, still upheld my spirits,
which were never less depressed than upon this
occasion. I remembered that the Great Director
still had not forsaken me, since ‘God is ever present,
ever felt, in the wide waste as in the full city,’
and I could not doubt that He whose outstretched
arm had preserved me through the conflict of
that dreadful night, would not now leave me to a
miserable death. I was now more comfortably situated
than at any former period; I had a covering
inside, and a keg of good wine outside. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
thing considered, I determined to wait with humble
hope, the will of heaven; I was resigned and cheerful,
and even sung, and was happy. After this, by
repeated drinking, owing to excessive thirst, I was
thrown into a doze of about half an hour.</p>

<p>It was now three days and nights since I had
taken food, and my taper of life began to glimmer
in the socket. How I survived these scenes of accumulated
misery so long, when but barely alive
on reaching the shore, I scarcely can tell; the retrospect
even now astonishes me. But frail mortality
could resist no longer; my strength had
utterly failed, and at this period I abandoned all
hope of again leaving the pipe.</p>

<p>The day was declining apace, and I expected not
to behold another dawn. I hailed the approaching
night as the termination of my toils; considered the
mean covering over me as my shroud, the cask as my
coffin, and waited with fortitude the hour of dissolution.
But the next was the hour of deliverance!</p>

<p>At four o’clock, on this afternoon, (Saturday,
the 20th of September,) as I was stretched out
in the cask, indulging in recollections of home,
I was aroused from my reveries by the startling
sound of a horse’s feet. I waited his approach
with calmness, being absolutely indifferent in my
choice, to sleep or die;—the sounds grew louder
and nearer—in a few moments a horse with a rider
appeared before the cask. I hailed in Spanish,
faintly, “amigo,” (friend,)—he instantly alighted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
but struck with such a ghastly spectacle as I then
exhibited, he started as he stooped down to observe
me, and recoiled backwards against his horse. Recovering
soon, however, from his dismay, by seeing
my helpless condition, he re-advanced to learn by
what means I had outlived the general wreck. He
was a young man of benevolent features, a Creole,
or half Indian, and dressed partly in the Indian
method. I told my tale in a few words, to which
he listened with breathless attention, and concluded
by asking him the distance to a habitation; and if
it was possible that he could furnish means for
reaching one the next day, as I had no idea but
that he came from a great distance. ‘In a few
hours,’ he replied; ‘before night, I can return with
horses and assistance, as my mother’s rancho, (or
hut) is not more than one league distant.’ After
a few more questions, he expressed his surprise at
my providential rescue, crossing himself repeatedly
at every ‘hair breadth escape,’ and blessed St.
George, as my special preserver. It was lucky, he
said, that I spoke his language so well; that I was
very fortunate in being discovered by him, whose
mother, he said, lived at the nearest habitation,
whither I should be conveyed; assuring me if I had
fallen into the hands of the savages, they would
certainly have despatched me, for they were merciless
and ferocious. But first says he, ‘I will bring
you something to eat, for you look half starved;’
so saying, he jumped upon his horse, and was soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
out of sight. His period of absence, seemed to me
an age. A prospect of deliverance, of once more
beholding my country, had lighted up a hope within
me, and again I feared he might prove a deceiver.</p>

<p>In about an hour, however, he appeared, and the
foam of his good horse bore witness that he had
lost no time. He jumped from his steed, and
threw into my lap, as I sat upright in the cask, a
warm sausage, and some mouldy bread, wrapped
up in a napkin. I greedily seized the food, thinking
I could devour it at once; but was surprised to
find I could not swallow a mouthful, my throat being
contracted, closed and sore.</p>

<p>He now informed me, that on his first coming
down to the beach, he had passed the pipe in which
I was laying, without suspicion, at a distance upon
his left, as he rode near the water; that he saw the
beach covered for a great length with numberless
articles of the wreck, and that he had been greatly
disconcerted on finding the sand dug away from
around a roll of cotton, and one carried off, and no
marks of footsteps, or any thing living, excepting
the sea gulls—that he had seen but one corpse, and
that of one of the sailors; that a great many chests,
trunks, &amp;c. he had likewise seen; some half buried
in the sand; others broken open by the sea; but
many that were locked and entire, and that if I
wished, he would search for my own, if I would describe
it, and draw it up before the cask. I told
him that my chests were unlocked at the time we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
struck, and of course the contents were scattered
and sunk. He however rode away to a great distance,
and drew up at repeated times, several chests
and trunks, belonging to the passengers and seamen,
saying that there were many more, but at
such a distance, so buried, or so heavy, that he
could not drag them along. He asked me for several
pieces of clothing, which he had picked up. I
told him to keep whatever he pleased, as none could
dispute his right to them. He then began to plan
the means for my removal; I thought it most practicable
that he should empty one of the largest
chests of its contents, and that I should get inside,
and his horse should draw me over the plains. This
he told me was impossible, from the shrubs and
marshes and pools, which obstructed the path. I
left it then wholly to his care, as my head was far
too heavy to talk or to reason; and from previous
exertion, even fell back into the cask. My friend
then made his lasso (a line of green hide, with
which they catch wild horses,) fast to the handle
of the largest trunk, and with an assurance that he
would soon return, drove off. I listened with painful
feelings to the sound of the horse’s retreating footsteps;
for on him alone rested my hope of deliverance.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had gone, a guacha, a savage of
fierce and murderous countenance, rode up and
alighted from his horse in great haste, and roughly
asked, ‘quien es usted?’ I replied, ’un marinero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
naufrago;’ ‘es usted el capitan?’ ‘no,’ I answered;
‘estoy el pilota,’ and that I had previously
been discovered by a paysano, who had just left me
to return with assistance. He demanded the road
he took; I told him, when he leaned upon his horse
and galloped off in the direction the other had taken.</p>

<p>It seems, as my deliverer afterwards informed
me, that this savage came up with him and endeavored
by entreaties and threats, to dissuade him
from his design of assisting me; saying I had better
be despatched and buried in the sand, and then
there would be none to dispute the right of plunder.
But my deliverer told him that the chief
was already acquainted with the affair, as well as
his father and others, who were even then preparing
to go down to the beach; on hearing this, he
lost no time, but turning his horse, hastily spurred
off in an opposite course.</p>

<p>During the absence of my friend, my moments
in the cask were spent in the most tormenting
anxiety and suspence. I had been discovered, contrary
to all conjecture, by a friend, instead of an
enemy, and one bright ray of hope, which I hardly
dared to cherish, had reanimated my soul. Now
was the fearful hazard that he should not return
with timely succor. I eagerly listened to catch
the sound of his returning galloping steed; after a
while I heard the approach of several horses; I
awaited their appearance with breathless hope, for
my life or my death hung upon the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>What was my dismay and surprise, at the next
moment, on beholding the remorseless face of the
same fellow who last had left me! his infernal companions
also dismounted, and presented their diabolical
visages at the mouth of the cask. For a
few moments their ensued a violent and clamorous
dispute between them, with horrid grimaces. Resistance
was madness; my feelings I will not attempt
to describe. Suddenly I saw their faces turned
to one direction; they instantly sheathed their
knives, and sprang toward their horses and vanished.</p>

<p>In a moment, my friend, accompanied by his father
and three slaves, alighted from their horses.
They immediately set about removing me gently
from the cask, while Pedro, (the name of my discoverer,)
breaking open a passenger’s trunk, that
lay near, advised me to permit him to draw over me
some of the apparel; alleging, that in my present
appearance, I should be taken by the inhabitants
for a common sailor; but if clothed in a decent
manner, I should gain among them more advantage,
respect and security. I, therefore, seated on the
sand, suffered the painful operation of dressing. A
surtout and waistcoat was got over me, but my leg
being so greatly swelled, prevented my getting over
it any thing but a pair of loose drawers. I was
then carefully lifted on the back of the horse; my
attentive friend Pedro leaped up before me; holding
on to him, I had strength sufficient to keep myself
in an upright position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>I had just been seated on the back of the animal,
when the general, who commanded the troops in
this quarter, appeared with a guard of soldiers, and
several others. He took me kindly by the hand,
promised me his protection, and taking a case bottle
of Aguadente from one of the guard, reached it
to me; I drank nearly half a pint, and felt much
enlivened. He then took off his pancho, or cloak,
and threw it over me; asking me if I preferred going
to the cottage of the party that had me in care, or
to his own quarters. I thanked him, and in reply
told him, that these had saved my life, and I
could trust them freely, and desired not to leave
them. Go on then, said he, con Dios, and to-night
I will visit you. We then set forward at a slow
pace, travelling along the windings of the beach.</p>

<p>I saw the body of a seaman, but we rode not near
enough for me to distinguish his features; he layed
upon his back, clothed in a red baize shirt and trowsers.
I looked around to see if there were others,
but my friend assured me there were none. The
beach was strewed with the wreck to a great length,
lying in every kind of position and in confused
masses.</p>

<p>The bright rays of the setting sun, now for a few
moments enlivened our path, as we left the beach
and turned off into the country, across the plains.
A negro preceded us on horseback, to sound the
way, as the land was wet and marshy. The raging
waves had now subsided to an unruffled calm, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
cast my eyes mournfully towards that treacherous
sea, which now looked so peaceful and flattering.</p>

<p>We arrived at last, about dusk, to a small cottage;
having travelled as I computed nearly a league.
A number of large dogs gave notice of our approach,
but were soon silenced by my companions, who assisted
me gently to dismount. I was welcomed with
many blessings by an old woman; carried into her
hut, seated in a chair, some clothing was brought
forward, and I soon felt the comfort of a dry shirt.
‘I have no beef or mutton in the house,’ says the
old woman, for the army take all our beasts; but
we have some fowls, which may do as well. I was
soon put in the only bed in the hut, to me a bed of
down; and my kind hostess soon brought me a bowl
of good broth. After this, my leg was washed with
hot vinegar, and my wounds on my feet dressed as
well as circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>This rancho, or hut, was a small place built like
all others, of cane, fastened together with strips of
green hide, plaistered with mud, and a thatch’d roof.
The general came about dark, spent an half hour,
and retired. I considered myself as peculiarly fortunate
on being now under the care of an old woman,
the indispensable attendant in sickness, and
alleviator of calamity; developing those endearing
and estimable traits of character, usefulness, patience
and compassion. My leg was again bathed
in hot vinegar, and bandages of woollen applied;
and my hostess left me and retired to her repose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
During the night I drank a great quantity both of
wine and water, which had been set within reach,
for my thirst was unquenchable. Two junk bottles
of hot water were covered and placed in bed
against my feet; which were much swelled, chilled,
and wrinkled, and almost without feeling. This
sudden application of artificial heat to the blood,
though well intended, had a most pernicious effect;
corrupting, stagnating, and destroying its natural
temperature, and causing great pain; its effects
were felt many months afterwards. During the
night I slept but little. The rays of the sun breaking
into the room, announced the morning of the
Sabbath, and I could in truth hail it as a welcome
and sweet day of rest.</p>

<p>I now took a view of the apartment and furniture;
the room was partly separated by a partition
of cane poles, inside of which slept my hostess
and her two younger sons, upon the floor; as
there was but one bedstead, upon which I lay. Her
eldest son, my discoverer, lay near me, wrapped
up in his pancho, or blanket; the old man, his father,
lived in another hut, at a relations, for fear of
the guaches, as he was a Spaniard.</p>

<p>At the further end of the hovel was kept constantly
burning upon a table, on each side of a crucifix,
two candles; which is the invariable custom
when any one lies dangerously sick. A separate
hut for the kitchen, was built outside. The furniture
consisted of a few hide bottomed chairs, some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
hide sacks and baskets, a hide sieve, and several
other necessary articles, of which hide was the
principal material. During the day, I inquired of
the old woman of the state of affairs about the
country, and at Monte Video. She told me that
the Portuguese were kept close within its walls by
the natives; and that any communication between
the city and country was very precarious and difficult,
as a great animosity subsisted between them.
Pedro at this time had mounted his cavallo, and
taken an excursion to the beach; towards night he
entered the hut, bringing in a hide sack of flour
from the wreck, which he had drawn away by the
aid of his horse; and soon after, brought in several
other articles, such as bottles of wine and cordial,
a keg of butter; some rum, and a keg of wine from
a cask—these he stowed away in the interior of the
hut, and then took his seat at my bedside as usual.</p>

<p>In conversation, he expressed to me his fears of
the intemperate and remorseless guachas, whom he
said, valued the life of a person no more than that
of a dog; that they were unsettled, roving, and
lived upon plunder. To beguile the evenings of
my tedious confinement, he would also relate to
me the products of the country, its animals, &amp;c.; a
choice horse might be bought for a dollar, though a
bad saddle would cost twenty. Ostriches were
plenty in the neighborhood, valuable only for their
eggs and feathers, of which they made fans and
dusters. The nature of this bird, he said, was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
singular, and he had often watched at a distance
their method of depositing their eggs; the bird, after
assuring herself of being unnoticed, would scratch
a hole in the sand, deposite her egg, and carefully
covering the place, retreat slyly to the thicket, and
leave to the sun the care of hatching them.</p>

<p>The next day, the general came again, bringing
with him several bottles of wine and cordial, which
he had taken from the wreck.</p>

<p>A country fellow came in soon after, an acquaintance
of my hostess; and she offered him a draught
of the cordial. I shall never forget the inexpressible
contortions of countenance, the heartfelt smack,
the exclamation of wonder and relish with which he
swallowed his glass of liquor, of the taste of which,
he had before no conception.</p>

<p>I desired the general to inform me if it was possible
to send a letter to Monte Video. He told me it
was difficult, as there was but little intercourse;
but that he knew of a patriot officer, who, having
a passport, would go in a few days to the city. I
therefore, the day following, procured of the old
woman, materials for writing, and a chopping block.
This I placed between my legs on the bed, and began
writing; it was a tedious business, and I could
sit up no longer than to write one line at a time.
I however finished this necessary duty, and wrote
two letters; one directed to W. P. White, Esq.,
the only person I was acquainted with at Monte
Video, whom I had formerly known in the capital;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and another to the owners in Buenos Ayres.
I briefly related the loss of the ship, the fate of the
crew, my own situation; and advising something to
be done to save the property; of which a greater
part had been washed ashore. These I gave to the
girl, who in two days forwarded them to the capital.</p>

<p>Pedro, during this day, was still employed, assisted
by the two slaves, in recovering articles and
provisions, from the beach; which he said was now
covered with the natives, who were breaking open
trunks, chests, and bales of goods; staving in the
pipes of wine, when any one wanted to drink; and
exhibiting a confused scene of plunder, fighting, and
wanton waste of goods; of which they knew not
the value.</p>

<p>Getting drunk with the wine, on the beach, they
frequently came to the cottage, and with brutal
language and savage gestures, threatened the lives of
its generous inhabitants.</p>

<p>As his mother was once bringing in some cakes
for me from the kitchen, the ruffians snatched them
from her hand; then entering the kitchen, seized
and devoured what victuals were there, and threw
away the plates.</p>

<p>She one day entered with tears in her eyes, and
told me she was sadly afraid of her life and my
own, from the Indians; they were very bad men;—and
she had overheard a parley between them, of
breaking into the hut during the night, to plunder
and murder. Indeed, their looks alone spoke their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
savage character; for often, at times, laying on my
bed, I have observed them attentively, as they
would sometimes venture into the hut; and I never
saw such rascally and ugly looking fellows. They
were generally of large size, long black hair, hanging
like snakes down their shoulders; thick bushy beard
and mustachios; a coarse blanket or pancho wrapped
round their waist; another with a hole in the
middle, through which they thrust their heads; a
turban or checked handkerchief on their heads;
horse skin boots, stripped raw from the animal’s
leg, and worn raw into the shape of the feet. These,
with a sword nearly a fathom long, in an iron scabbard,
gave them a most hideous appearance; they
indeed looked like demons. All wore long knives
stuck into a sheath, in the blanket behind, which
they made use of for every purpose; to kill, cut up
beef, eat with, and stab their fellow creatures.</p>

<p>The friendly general again came in the evening,
attended by several soldiers; and at his departure,
left a guard of three at our earnest request, who
were well armed, for our defence. This military
officer, whose name was Ortugues, appeared much
like one of our own country farmers, excepting his
formidable iron scabbard sword. His dress was a
short jacket of coarse blue, over which was thrown
his pancho, or square cloak, drab velvet breeches,
and long boots; he seemed a well meaning and benevolent
man; but no ways capable of commanding
a horde of vagabond marauders, whom he was organising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
into an army, for the defence of the country,
against the encroachments of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The cause of the Indians’ animosity and attempts
to attack and plunder, was, that they suspected as
Pedro was the first who had discovered the wreck
on the beach, he had the first chance of booty, and
of course had obtained a great quantity of gold,
silver, and other valuable property; and had secreted
them in the cottage. Impressed with this notion,
which I believe was false and groundless, they
made several nightly attempts to force the door,
but were repulsed by the guard.</p>

<p>I passed these days very unquietly at the cottage,
and time seemed to roll most tediously slow.
The old lady had some cigars and old books, and I
endeavored, by smoking and reading, to beguile the
hours. The books, though some were an hundred
and fifty years old, were not uninteresting. They
consisted partly of the ‘Lives of the Martyrs;’
‘Sermons by a Priest at Madrid;’ and a large volume
of the ‘History of the Conquest of Peru.’</p>

<p>In the evening, Pedro would take his seat at the
bedside, and amuse and interest me by his conversation.
On an occasion like this, he said, he would
relate the following tale, which before he had no
opportunity to do. It shows that my discovery and
rescue were wholly owing to a circumstance purely
fortuitous and accidental.</p>

<p>‘Early in the morning of Thursday,’ said he, ‘two
days before you were found on the strand, a soldier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of the army of Artigas was strolling on horseback
nearer the beach than they usually travel. At about
a mile from the scene of the wreck, he discerned in
a small cove at the river side, something on the
beach; and as it was uncommon to observe any object
breaking the uniformity of the sandy plain, he
resolved to ride down and examine it. It proved
to be one of the kegs of butter, nearly the size
of a half barrel, which had been separated by the
sea from the other drifting articles, and washed and
lodged into this little bay. The soldier alighted
from his horse, turned it over, but could not tell
what it contained. It being heavy, and thinking it
of little value, he left it and rode away. Some time
after, in his return, he came near our cottage; he
had before frequently stopped here; and now resolved
to go in. In the course of conversation with
me, on different affairs, he mentioned the discovery,
at the river side, of a small barrel, very heavy;
containing he knew not what, and supposed it to
have drifted ashore from some vessel. Soon after,
he left the cottage, and proceeded on his journey.
That day and the next, being very stormy, cold
and rainy, prevented me from going abroad. On
Saturday the weather was still unfair, but at noon
it began to clear away. I mounted my cavallo in
the afternoon, and took a ride in the direction described
by the soldier, in search of the keg he had
spoken of. This I soon saw at the edge of the
water, and supposing that this was not all that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
been driven ashore by the storm, I was induced to
make a further search; and recollecting that the
wind had been for several days blowing obliquely up
the river, I concluded to shape my course down the
sea side for new discoveries. Accordingly, I rode
on a great distance, without seeing any thing else,
and was on the point of returning; when, on winding
round a small point of land, I plainly saw at a
short distance a thousand vestiges of the wreck
covering the beach. I rode slowly through them,
near the edge of the water, stopping at times to
view them, but not dismounting. I passed the cask
you lay in, which I saw was thrown very high up
the beach. ‘It was rather strange,’ said he, ‘that
you did not hear my horse’s steps.’ I told him I
did not; for the tread on the sand was not loud,
and the roar of the sea might serve to prevent
it. ‘I traversed the whole length of the beach,
and frequently stopped to examine different objects
of the wreck. I had probably been half an hour
on the beach, before I had a thought of one alive
so near me.’ I told him I was, during the period
of his survey, lying quietly in the cask, without a
hope of again leaving it, and wholly unconscious deliverance
was so near. ‘In returning,’ he continued,
‘I was passing close to the sand hill between the
banks and your place of shelter, and should have
passed the cask, if I had not heard a hollow voice
from within.’ I inquired if the roll of bagging
across the pipe’s mouth, did not attract his notice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
‘No, my friend pilota,’ said Pedro, ‘I should certainly
have rode on without regarding it; for I had
seen a hundred things just before, in equally curious
positions. Your voice alone, which started me
at first, caused me to dismount, and look into the
cask; and my God, I shall never forget the sight
as long as I live.’ What a scene was this for the
pencil of the painter!</p>

<p>On the eve of about the fourth day, I asked Pedro,
if any of the bodies had washed ashore, besides
the one we saw. He replied, not one; and
wondered how that alone should be cast so far on
shore.</p>

<p>I told him I presumed it was one of the stoutest
of the seamen, who had fortunately cleared himself
from the ship, without much damage, and had resolutely
continued ‘breasting the lofty surge,’ till he
reached the middle of the breakers; when, being
there overpowered, he expired and sunk; and the
force of the waves then propelled the body to the
shore before it descended to the bottom.</p>

<p>It is surprising that human bodies will, when
dead, sink and continue at the bottom, unmoveable;
while other substances, of much greater proportionate
weight, will be thrown on shore by the sea.</p>

<p>My friend brought in, and shew me, at different
times, large detached pieces of iron, and ring bolts,
&amp;c. which he found half buried in the sand.</p>

<p>I was now slowly gaining strength; but each returning
day brought fresh alarm from the murderous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
designs of the villain guachas. On the fourth
night they went to the next hut upon the beach,
about four miles off, where dwelt a poor and harmless
family, and robbed it of every thing valuable,
or worth taking; mortally stabbed the father; bound
his daughters, and brutally abused them. One of
them, an interesting white girl, came the next day
to our hut, for some relief, and told in tears the
dreadful story.</p>

<p>I had about this time, a great many visiters, who
all considered me highly favored by my patron
saint, to whom they attributed my hair breath escapes.
Among them, were many old women, who
came from a distance, and travelled on horseback,
about the country, bartering their commodities.</p>

<p>A consultation was once held by them, respecting
my fever, leg, and bruises; and they recommended
a large leaf of an herb, which grows in that
country; which, dipped in hot oil and vinegar, had a
wonderful and salutary effect when applied to my
limb; although the application caused a most uneasy
sensation, combined with suffocating pain during
two nights; the swelling greatly subsided, excepting
about the bend of the knee. During this, for five
days, I could lie in only one position in bed, and that
on my right side; my wounded leg lying on pillows;
the knee bent about half way; in which unvaried
bend, it remained in fact, more than a month.</p>

<p>I could instantly perceive a change of wind, on
the least motion; and once on moving, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
wind had shifted to the north, the effect was so
electric as to cause me to scream aloud. And when,
at last, I was compelled to relieve for a moment
my painful and palsying posture, it was the task of
half an hour to turn myself in bed.</p>

<p>My appetite, at this time, had become insatiate,
and though I could not get so much to eat as I
wanted, owing to the care of my old nurse, I ate
great quantities, and drank all that came within
my reach; keeping bottles of liquor under my pillow,
for my night supply. The smallest lad’s chief
occupation was to bring in water; of which, during
the twelve days I remained here, I believe I drank
fifty gallons, besides half a dozen bottles of cordial,
a dozen of wine, ten gallons of port, in a keg, and
several bottles of other liquors; all of which Pedro
had saved from the beach.</p>

<p>My condition appeared to engross all the attention
of my kind hostess, and occupy all her care
and time. She never entered the apartment, nor
went to sleep, without the kind question of ‘que
quero usted, pilota?’ (what is wanting;) and the
answer was usually, ‘water.’</p>

<p>I asked her one afternoon what reward she expected,
or what recompense I should give; or what
return I could make, for her untiring goodness.
‘Speak not of it, Don Horky,’ said she; ‘who can
tell but that my son Pepe, may go to other countries
by sea, and be shipwrecked, and cast ashore,
and that your mother may then do that and more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
for him, than I am doing now for you.’ It was an
answer heartfelt, I believe, by us both, though I
smiled to think on the improbability that Pedro
could be thrown ashore in a storm, upon a wharf in
Boston.</p>

<p>This family had lived many years happily and
comfortably in Monte Video, previous to its surrender
to the Patriots, in 1813; but were then compelled
to quit their home; and since that period, had
suffered, as well as many other families, all the
hardships to which their adhesion to the cause of
old Spain, exposed them. The old man, her husband,
was in constant fear of his life; and during
my stay at the hut, which drew many unwelcome
visiters, appeared only once or twice, and then only
in the evening; living otherwise, as before mentioned,
at a relation’s, concealed.</p>

<p>On the second evening, he came and inquired of
his wife about me, as follows: ‘Bien,’ says he, ‘como
esta su huespedo?’ ‘mucho mejor,’ she replied;
‘tiene gano muy vivo para beber y comer;’ ‘esta
christiano?’ he asked, which made me smile. ‘Sin
duda,’ she replied; ‘todas son christianos en Norte
America;’ ‘como los Inglesas y el pilota sabe las
nombres de todas los santas, y puede repeto el
credo catolico.’ ‘Dios le guarda,’ he replied; and
to me, ‘a Dios, usted le passa bein;’ so saying, he
left the cottage.</p>

<p>On inquiring my health, and asking if I was a
christian, she answered, ‘much better;’ and doubtless
a christian, as all in America, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
English, were christians; and that as evidence, I
could repeat the Catholic creed, and knew the
names of all the saints; for which he bestows his
benediction.</p>

<p>When at times I would whistle and sing, to beguile
the pain, my hostess would ask the reason.
I told her I did so to kill the pain. But I saw she
often thought from my strange behaviour, that my
fever and pain had rendered me delirious. My apprehensions,
however, in this weak state, and nervous
debility of body and mind, gave me incessant
and tormenting anxiety.</p>

<p>The close of each day gave rise to painful fears,
for the events of the dreaded night; expecting constantly
the breaking in of the guachas; and knowing
too well their merciless ferocity. The nightly
barking of the watchful dogs, giving notice of their
approach, sounded in my ears like a summons bell,
tolling for execution. I was not certain of living
out an hour, nor was my chance of life of the value
of a shilling.</p>

<p>One night, when all had retired to rest, and the
guards lay snoring upon the floor, the dogs set up
a roaring yell, and we soon after heard the tread of
heavy footsteps, and violent thumping at the door.
Pedro, who lay at my side, aroused the guards and
opened it; while the soldiers and my hostess prepared
for defence.</p>

<p>I saw by the moonshine, five hideous looking fellows,
armed with swords and bayonets, standing
before the door. A sharp parley ensued between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
them and the guard. They said that they had orders
to search the hut for any money or valuables,
that the pilota, (myself,) might have recovered from
the wreck. But the guard presenting their pieces,
told them it was all false, and a contrivance to
plunder; as they themselves were placed there by
the General for my defence, and they would directly
fire upon them, unless they instantly made off.</p>

<p>At this, they thought proper to make a speedy
retreat, stealing in their way a horse from the field.</p>

<p>I was now in anxious and daily expectation of
some persons from Monte Video, to convey me
from this fearful situation and dangerous abode.
On the eighth day, I was agreeably relieved, by the
arrival of two clerks, an Englishman and Spaniard,
from Monte Video, in consequence of receiving my
letters, from the house of the consignees, in order
to effect my removal to the city, and also to endeavor
to secure some part of the property.</p>

<p>The latter they found totally impossible, nothing
of value being now left on the strand, as all had
been carried up country, by the natives.</p>

<p>I was extremely rejoiced at their coming, and we
were soon concerting plans for my departure. Lines
and posts of defence had been established between
Toledo, the place where I was, and Monte Video,
and these prevented any cattle or provisions being
carried from the country to the Portuguese, in the
city, whom they considered as invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>Oxen, therefore, not being allowed to pass into
the city, mules not here to be procured, it was at
last agreed that they should return to Monte Video,
and send down a cart with mules, from the city.
They slept one night at the hut, and on the next
day, Sunday, departed; having seen sufficient of
the character of the natives, and glad they had
escaped the knives of the guachas, and vowing
they would not venture their lives again among
such a murderous crew, for the value of a ship and
cargo.</p>

<p>On the eve of the next day, Monday, Pedro
brought in the trunk which he had drawn from the
beach at my desire, at the time of my discovery,
and now opened it to examine what articles it might
contain. He told me he had hitherto kept it secreted
in the grass, in the rear of the cot; and had
not dared to take out any articles to dry for fear
of the deserters and Indians; for should they discover
any thing valuable hanging out, they would
certainly steal it, and search the house for more.
But none of them being now near the house, he
had brought it in to the side of the bed, for my inspection.</p>

<p>It was a large black English iron-bound trunk, of
the largest size, containing every article of clothing,
but no money. These were all thoroughly wet,
and many indelibly spotted and mildewed, the effects
of the salt water. This stock of apparel
was at this time a great acquisition to me, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
my whole wardrobe consisted of a borrowed shirt.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Among the things he handed me, were a set of
long muslin curtains for a state room; which the
old lady begged I would give to her. And Pedro
in his turn, thought that a couple pair of the pantaloons
would make him happy as a cavallero; to
which I readily assented, and told them I laid claim
to nothing but their hospitality, for which I was a
constant debtor.</p>

<p>At the bottom was found a large roll of papers,
which he handed me, and carefully unrolling them,
I expected they were a set of interesting manuscripts;
but found them to be only a collection of
beautiful colored French engravings; such as the
four seasons, twelves months, subjects from scripture,
Robinson Crusoe, &amp;c.; in all about forty;
which I requested Pedro to hang on a line overhead
to dry, which he did. Most of the contents were
then stowed again in the trunk, and Pedro dragged
it back to its place of concealment.</p>

<p>The next morning I awoke with earnest expectation
of the cart from Monte Video; but I waited in
vain; and evening brought fresh cause of fear.</p>

<p>During this day, an Irishman, a laborer, who had
lived many years in that country, came; and after
some conversation with my hostess, requested of
her the loan of a spade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>He said he had but just come from the beach,
and that several bodies of my companions lay exposed
on the sand, and that the gulls were devouring
them; that the Indians were too intent on plunder,
and getting intoxicated, to assist in interring
them; and that he would again go down to perform
this christian office, and bury them in the sand.</p>

<p>An old kind of shovel was mustered for him, and
he went off with this laudable design. Returning
the next day, he informed me he had buried several,
and many bodies had come ashore in a shocking
state; so broken and bruised that it was impossible
to distinguish them; some, he said, were still in
the surf, which he could not drag out; and of necessity,
had to leave, ‘food for gulls;’ their bones,
doubtless, at this day, lie bleaching on the sand.</p>

<p>I was still waiting with the most painful anxiety,
for the arrival of the conveyance from the city;
and no poor and condemned malefactor, in hopes of
a reprieve, or pardon, ever waited with more emotion
the mandate which should restore him his liberty,
than I did for a passport and conveyance to
the walls of Monte Video.</p>

<p>The cannibals were daily and hourly growing
more barbarous; and our danger every moment increased.
I had every reason to believe that on this
night, they intended to make a desperate attack
upon the cottage, and to have murdered all in their
power. But Providence otherwise ordered.</p>

<p>About sunset, the little lad came running into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the hut, from his play, exclaiming to his mother,
that ‘a strange thing was coming towards the house.’
My heart throbbed a little at this notice, and soon
after, as I hoped for, I was gratified with the entrance
of the driver and guide, of the long wished
for cart. They were cordially welcomed; and as
they slept in the hut, I passed the night with a more
temperate feeling, and a mind less apprehensive of
a midnight attack.</p>

<p>To death, and to danger the most terrific, I had
been exposed, and had faced them with manly
firmness. I had escaped from wild beasts, and met
the fury of elements, without shrinking; but the
horrid prospect of having my flesh gashed and lacerated,
by the knives of the savages, gave me infinite
anguish; and heated with fever, rage and indignation,
I could almost, at times, had it been in my
power, have seized indiscriminate destruction, and
like Samson of old, have sacrificed my own life to
relieve it from such a state of torturing suspence,
and to take revenge upon the blood thirsty ruffians;
for here were men, if I may so degrade the term,
(for they were not indeed in the image of their Maker,)
‘more fierce and more inexorable far, than
empty tigers, or the roaring sea.’</p>

<p>The twelfth day came, and we were to depart.
I hailed it with pleasure, as a day of second deliverance.
The guide and the driver were employed
in the morning, in lining the side of the cart with
rushes, to keep off the wind; they had brought down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
with them a bed, with coverings and blankets. The
trunk was brought and laid across the fore part of
the cart, by Pedro; while his mother was busy in
wrapping me up within, for the journey. A great
number of blankets and coverings, were also thrown
over me. My feet were bound up in woollen, and a
flag handkerchief was tied round my head; I had
on, likewise, a large coat, loose pantaloons, and flannel
underdress. A chair was placed at the hinder
part of the cart, which now backed to the door of
the cottage, from which I was lifted inside and placed
upon the blankets at the bottom.</p>

<p>At parting I shook the hands of the kind old woman,
and my deliverer, most heartily. A crowd of
grateful recollections stifled for a moment my expressions
of gratitude, and started the tears of overpowered
feelings. I left them with fervent benedictions,
and we drove off slowly on our way.</p>

<p>During our progress, I had leisure to contemplate
my hopes and prospects; and my mind wanted no
food or exercise in considering this odd journey,
and in so odd a company.</p>

<p>The sun beamed forth gloriously, and the day appeared
delightful; and though I could not yet hear
the busy hum of men, yet the cheering music of the
feathered warblers, the sight of the vast plains on
one side, and the boundless expanse of the great
La Plata on the other; the novelty of my situation,
the memory of past dangers, the many aids of Providence,
whose unseen hand had protected me thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
far, and the hopes of future comforts yet in store,
led my thoughts to adore that great and benevolent
Being, without whose notice, not even a sparrow
falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable, excepting one unlucky accident,
happened on the road, which was the loss
of the engravings. The guide, who was an ill looking
and suspicious fellow, who lived in the vicinity,
had collected them from the lines in the hut, and
put them under the bed at the tail of the cart.
When about half way on our journey, he suddenly
dropped astern, and saying he could go on no farther,
pulling out the prints, thrust them into his
bosom, galloped off and vanished.</p>

<p>We were interrogated at the lines by some officers,
who came out of a decent house by the roadside,
as we were now near the city, who asked many
questions, and allowed us freely to proceed; in a
short time we gained sight of the gates of Monte
Video; at which we at last arrived about 2 o’clock,
P. M. Here I was also stopped by a number of
Portuguese officers, who were tall and well looking
men, who asked also many questions, having previously
heard of the shipwreck; they expressed themselves
glad to see me, and we drove into the city.</p>

<p>The streets were not paved, but contained many
large loose stones; and the jolting of the cart over
them, which now went at a smart trot, gave me a
severe shaking. The novelty of the sight drew
many of the females to the windows; and I beheld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
many wondering and fair faces, as I lay on my back
in the cart, exposed to the view of those above me.</p>

<p>We stopped at the house of an English merchant,
the consignee, who immediately came out, and with
many friendly congratulations, personally assisted
his slaves in carrying me up stairs; passing along on
the flat roof of the lower story, round the court
yard, in the centre, to a small handsome chamber in
the rear, which had been previously fitted up for
the use of one of our passengers. His family consisted
of his wife, likewise English, and an interesting
and beautiful child, of about three years old. His
lady, (whom Heaven bless,) was constant in her acts
of kindness. I found I could not support myself
in a chair, for this was the first time, since the disaster,
that I had made the attempt, and was therefore
helped to undress, and assisted to bed. This
night I slept for the first time soundly; for I had
reached the desired place of security, and my
dreams were not disturbed by the clamor of the
guachas.</p>

<p>The next day, my trunk was opened, and the
clothes washed and put up in the neatest order.
Two whole pieces of black bombazette, and several
dozen of white cotton hose and socks, were likewise
found in it; which were sold, and brought me
about thirty dollars.</p>

<p>Here I was confined for nearly thirty days, and
my leg shrunk in that time to as great an extreme
as it was swelled before. By unexampled kindness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
I daily and rapidly improved; and in three weeks
was able to leave the room, and sit outside of the
chamber, upon the walk.</p>

<p>One of the owners of the ship happening at this
time to be in Monte Video, instantly came to visit
me, and hear the account of the loss of his ship.
When I had repeated the occurrences, and related
the hospitality of the old woman at the cottage, he
immediately proposed a subscription among the
merchants for her recompense, generously and nobly
disregarding his own loss, though he was owner
of half of the ship, and uninsured. There came
also next day, notaries to take my deposition on
oath, respecting the cause of the ship’s being thrown
ashore. It was accordingly set down as occasioned
by the violence of the storm.</p>

<p>I was often solicited by my kind friends, to have
medical assistance; but this I constantly refused. I
had never occasion for a physician, having, doubtless
unreasonably, a prejudice against them; nature
therefore took her course, and my leg, though once
threatened with amputation, grew daily stronger,
to the surprise of all who first witnessed my situation,
and slowly resumed its natural shape; and in
six weeks, I was able to take the salutary exercise
of a walk, with a cane; to ride a short distance
upon a gentle horse, and shortly after, eat at their
table.</p>

<p>Gratitude must here be allowed a digression, to
give vent to her feelings, and to prevent her devoirs
at the shrine of benevolence. While under this hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
roof, all that could contribute to alleviate
pain; everything that could add to my convenience
and comfort; kindness, which anticipated my wishes,
I enjoyed in its fullest extent. Though a distressed
foreigner, I was treated as a brother; and
though a stranger, ever welcome to their board.
For three weeks, while on the bed of friendship, I
was visited at the first dawn of the morning by the
worthy merchant, who with his own hands would
dress my wounds, thus emulating the example of
the good Samaritan.</p>

<p>His name, <span class="smcap">John L. Darby</span>, Esq. I with pleasure
record. A name well known to the mercantile
community, at Monte Video; and while life continues,
will with me be held dear.</p>

<p>It would be well, if I could here conclude, and
the hapless tale could now be ended. But as a
faithful narrator, I am constrained to give its melancholy
sequel.</p>

<p>After I had been in Monte Video about six weeks,
I received the shocking intelligence, that on the
night of the same day on which I left the cottage,
the merciless savages attacked and entered the hut
of the old woman, and finding no opposition, as the
guards had withdrawn to the encampment, plundered
the hut of all she possessed, wounded the slaves
who opposed them, and after repeatedly stabbing
my worthy deliverer, finished with cutting his throat
from ear to ear! How just are the words of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The ways of heaven are dark, and intricate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man, puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errors,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sees not with how much art the windings turn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor when the regular confusion ends.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was now rapidly gaining strength; my leg I
could bear my weight on; and after remaining here
two months, I was strong enough to take passage
for Buenos Ayres, distant about a hundred and ten
miles, farther up, and on the opposite side of the
river.</p>

<p>I arrived the next day, and found a great number
of old acquaintance, who were very kind and
friendly. A subscription paper was immediately
handed round among the English merchants, by
the goodness of the owners, Messrs. <span class="smcap">McFarlane</span>
and <span class="smcap">Eastman</span>, to whose friendship I must ever remain
indebted, and several hundred subscribed in
an hour, and collected for my benefit. About two
hundred were also collected for the benefit of the
old woman at the hut, and two hundred more previously
in Monte Video, and sent down to her.</p>

<p>I remained some months on account of lameness
in Buenos Ayres, and applied for a passage in the
Congress, Captain Sinclair, which was at that time
ready to return home with the three commissioners
which she conveyed out; but failing in this, I
soon after had an application to the birth of first
officer of a large ship; the Manhattan, of 700 tons,
sent from the United States to be sold. Not succeeding
in the sale, I entered on board an Enserada,
and we proceeded to fit her for her return home
in ballast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>On the 11th of July, 1818, we left the La Plata,
and in forty days had sight of Bermudas. On the
12th of September, we anchored off Fort Henry,
at Baltimore. I was detained here much against
my will, twenty days, in settling the ship’s accounts,
taking an inventory, &amp;c. and she was publicly sold.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, October 4th, I arrived at
my native place, Boston, after an absence of over
two years; when I fully experienced the truth of
the observation, that the unavoidable evils and misfortunes
of life, afford by their contrast, a ten fold
relish to its comforts, which are many, but which
before were unprised.</p>

<p>The meeting of relatives must be conceived. I
will only add, that safe in the embrace of parents
and friends, forgotten like a dream, WERE THE
PERILS OF THE OCEAN.</p>

<h3>RIO JENEIRO.</h3>

<p>Rio Jeneiro, in English, the River January—probably
so called from the month in which it was
discovered—embraces the varied prospect of a bay
incomparable in scenery, a smooth harbor, variegated
with many pleasant little islands, which secure
and embellish it; the shores on every side teeming
in luxuriant vegetation, and where nature, dressed
always in the robe of spring—gay as in her prime—sports
in all her youthful vigor and beauty. On
first beholding this coast, the mind of a stranger is
struck with wonder and pleasure—he beholds mountains
piled on mountains, of every shape and posture—some
bending their enormous heads, as if to awe
the lesser hills below, or rising in majestic pomp
far above the highest range of clouds, which float
and curl, like misty veils, around them. The city,
St. Sebastian, is surrounded with a range of these
high mountains, which rise at a short distance in
the interior, and enclose it as in a semicircle. This
barrier prevents the circulation of the pure mountain
breezes, and occasions a pale and sickly appearance
in the sallow complexions of the inhabitants;
the streets, too, which appear like lanes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
an European, are narrow, and the houses lofty,
which gives them, at first, a wild and gloomy appearance.
The buildings are mostly of brick or
stone, and plastered; but the eye of the pedestrian
is soon diverted from them, and arrested by the
endless change in the faces, dresses and complexions
of the passing swarms that press about him,
and throng this populous, transatlantic city.</p>

<p>Here may be seen at one view, the well-fed priest
pushing his fat body along, and the half starved slave
who touches his cap to him, though he is sweating
under the weight of a puncheon, which he assists in
bearing along. The bold free negro, with his cocked
hat, and the stiff, proud courtier, with his ribbands
and stars; the thievish soldier off duty, watching
a group of sailors over their pot of wine, at the
chop house; and the strapping female slave, who
cries ‘aick!’ and sells water, the weight of which, in
the balanced vessel on her head, would crack any
skull of less solidity than her own; the naval captain
in his full dress, brushing by a noisy pack of
young black children, with no dress at all; the begging
friar from the convent, who fills his wallet with
provisions, and never knew a different mode of living;
the statesman in black, who kisses on his knees
at the palace door, the one hand of the prince, while
he is eating an apple, a favorite fruit, with the other;
the royal guard of grenadiers, whose antique
lengthy coats, make them appear like men of other
days; the droves of blacks, whose skeleton shapes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
bespeak them wretches just released from yonder
slave ship—these may be seen at once.</p>

<p>But where, oh, where, is lovely woman? To the
face of whom, from the face of naught for tedious
months, but boisterous waves and frowning clouds,
the seamen with most pleasure turns. But here he
turns in vain, for none are seen. The sounds too,
which stun him, are as varied as the objects around.
The ceaseless clang of a hundred bells,
ringing too, rapid as for life and death; the song
and chorus of the laboring slaves, at the quay; guns
firing, rockets mounting, drums beating, chains
clanking, and rocks blowing, would lead a stranger
to suppose that they made all this clamor to
drive away ennui, and disperse evil spirits.</p>

<p>The queen’s garden, at the extremity of the city,
appears to merit most attention. It is very spacious,
and is bounded on one side by the bay, against
the wall of which the surf beats and roars, in great
contrast with the scenery within. The walks are
very neat, and some charmingly shaded from the
sun, cool and solitary. But it is in the country only,
outside the town, that the naturalist and admirer
of untrammelled nature, may enjoy her richest banquet,
for here she spreads her boards with boundless
variety. The air, though at first rather too
warm, is generally refreshed by the pure breeze of
the mountains, and every thing appears bright and
beautiful; the mind in the delightful region, unwittingly
glows in unison with the cheerful prospect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and insensibly imbibes the serenity and the grandeur
of the surrounding landscapes.</p>

<p>On a Sunday afternoon, I took an excursion up
the bay; on landing, I pursued the course of the
beach, and was charmed with the stillness and the
cheerfulness of the scenery around me. Here the
sweet scented lemon tree, the orange, and the lime,
extending even to the touch of the wave, afforded
a delightful retreat from the blaze of a tropical sun.</p>

<p>The beautiful and nimble lizards, which I had
thought repulsive reptiles, were playing about
among the stones of the beach. The velocity of
their motions, their sudden change of attitude, and
their elegant and symmetrical forms—with their
little green eyes, pointed noses, taper tails and
spotted bodies, afforded a deal of amusement. We
then bent our way into the interior. Here we travelled
along at the foot of an immense hill, whose
sloping sides were covered, as far as the eye could
reach, with thick woods of oranges and other tropical
fruits.</p>

<p>In a little time we fell in with a party of merry
making blacks, of both sexes, who were indulging,
in all its glory, the jubilee of a Fandango. This is
a sort of African dance of the negroes, of which
they are excessively fond; it is performed by numerous
evolutions, in which they sometimes join
hands and form a circle, in the centre of which, are
the indefatigable and sweating musicians, who, with
their huge calabashes, kettle drums and reed pipes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
labor to make all the noise—if not the most musical—they
possibly can. The dancers, more especially
the women, are most fantastically arrayed, having
on the head a cap or turban, ornamented with
beads, ribbons and small looking glasses; a short,
gay dress, a string of beads—negro fine—around
their necks, and the wrists and ankles encircled by a
string of castanos, a nut shell, the rattle of which, in
the dance, keeps time to the music. No one can behold,
with unruffled face, or with any degree of
gravity, the negro Fandango. The ridiculous dresses,
the expressive, though awkward pantomimic motions
and gestures, the contortion of features, and
the horrid <i>music</i>, present a strange and lively picture.</p>

<p>Proceeding a little further, we came in sight of a
noble palace, which had been lately built, and which
was surrounded by an extensive stone wall, having
the grand gate-way, or entrance, arched, and bearing
the arms of Portugal and John VI. On arriving
at the palace, we found it was built of stone, surrounded
by another solid wall. At a short distance,
on the right, buildings of brick were erecting for
spacious barracks. The situation was commanding
and beautiful, and we little expected to enjoy, in a
solitary country ramble, where the silence was only
interrupted by the singing of birds, the view of so
noble an edifice.</p>

<p>On returning, we fell in with a number of female
slaves, who were busily employed in washing. They
stood in a large square basin of water, at least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
three feet deep, and were jabbering and rubbing,
with their trays on the banks. The country appeared
well watered, and the soil very productive.</p>

<p>In the city, the water is supplied by several public
fountains, which are built of stone, in a pyramidical
form, from the sides of which, through four
spouts, the water is forced out in spattering streams.
The principal one is at the head of the palace steps,
near the square. The slaves, who get water from
this source, to sell about the city, make a great
clamor in their contentions about first getting their
vessels under the stream.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vast crowds which throng
the streets, not a woman is to be seen. Although
I was at one time on shore daily, for three weeks,
I could see no other females than the slaves.—They
sometimes, however, take a ramble in the
evening, but are so enveloped in cloaks that entirely
conceal their form, that a stranger would pass
them, and think them men. They may be seen,
also, at the gratings of the upper windows on some
days of parade and processions, and on Sundays
may be seen leaving their palanquins to enter the
church; but otherwise are confined, by tyrant custom,
to their lone apartments. How different is
their fate from that of the perambulators of Broadway
and Cornhill! The population, including slaves,
probably amounts to eighty thousand. Though
there are guard houses for soldiers in many sections,
murders are very frequent; so common, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
that the dead body of the unfortunate victim, weltering
in blood, is passed by in the street, with, perhaps,
the exclamation of ‘poor fellow!’ but other
wise unheeded and without concern.</p>

<p>There are many foreign merchants who reside
here and in the vicinity, several of whom have their
families with them; but the state of society must
prevent the enjoyment of all social intercourse, and
deprive them of those pleasures so necessary to the
happiness of domestic life.</p>

<p>Fruits of many kinds, such as oranges, lemons,
limes, plantains, bananas, cocoa nuts, &amp;c., are very
cheap and plenty. Sugar, rice and tobacco, they
raise and export in great quantities; but should
some of our chewers of the latter article witness
the nauseous method of its manufacture and packing,
by the dirty blacks, they would, I think, as I
have seen others, eject the quid in disgust. The
beef is bad and lean, the cattle being driven before
they are killed, a great distance from the interior.</p>

<p>Multitudes of the slaves gain a profit to their
owners, by the conveyance of passengers in their
canoes, to and from the shipping and the landing
places. Their strife for employment is violent and
clamorous; but it sometimes happens, if their price
of fare—which must be paid on the passage—is not
agreed to, the black rogue will dexterously capsize
his canoe, tow it quickly to the shore, and leave
you to be picked up by the first passing skiff that
may take that trouble.</p>

<p>The king’s barge is very splendid. His majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
sometimes takes an excursion round the harbor, attended
by his suite, and is rowed by eighty men,
having twenty oars on a side, and two men to each.
A band of music precedes him, and the numerous
barges which follow, all handsomely decorated, form
a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>On Sundays and other holidays, the church processions
are extraordinary. On a Sunday afternoon,
soon after my first arrival in Rio Jeneiro, I witnessed
a grand example of the above fetes. The streets
were thronged with a gaping multitude, who were
eager to pay their devotion to the rites of mother
church. First in advance appeared a guard of soldiers,
marching to slow music; these were followed
by a number of citizens, dressed in black, each bearing
a long, lighted, wax taper; then came a small
guard of soldiers, followed by four beautiful females,
dressed in light muslin, having wings of gauze, extended
by wires, and crowned with a wreath of
flowers, holding in their hands emblems of a harp;
and immediately following, under a superb canopy,
upheld by eight soldiers, appeared the grand object
of all this ceremony, the reverend and holy Father
of the church, to whom, as he moved along in mighty
pomp and solemn show, the crowd on each side
spontaneously dropped and bowed the knee. Another
file of soldiers and citizens next came up, followed
by the underlings of the church—some of
various shades of color, even to sooty black, but
who were, notwithstanding, arrayed in clerical robes—brought
up the rear of this gorgeous pageant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<h3>LA PLATA.</h3>

<p>In thirty four degrees south latitude, equi-distant
from the equator as New York, is the grand
and majestic La Plata. On approaching the river
from the sea, the low and level land appears wholly
different in appearance from the wild and towering
front along the coast of Brazil.</p>

<p>This vast river is a hundred and fifty miles wide at
the mouth, and extends, with a gradual contraction
and in a winding direction, along the shores of Paraguay,
in the heart of South America, a distance of
twelve hundred miles. At Monte Video the water is
brackish, and cannot be drank, but at a short distance
above, though it appears at all times turbid
and discolored, as if with the yellow mud at the
bottom; the taste is sweet and palatable. A sealing
ship was once cast away on the rocks of Faulkland
Island, and a few of the hands with difficulty saved
themselves in the long boat. Being on a barren
land, they resolved, with one barrel of beef, which
they had fortunately recovered, and a scanty supply
of water, to commit themselves to the mercy of the
waves in their frail bark, and pushed for the river
of Plate. After a miserable passage and expending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
their entire stock of provisions, they arrived at last,
even to the inner roads of Buenos Ayres, ascended
the deck of the first vessel they saw, and implored,
‘in the name of God,’ a draught of water!—having
traversed over a surface of one hundred miles of
good fresh water, for twenty four hours, not apprehending
that it was fresh, and sailed dismally over
it, perishing with intolerable thirst.</p>

<p>The tides in the river, as far up as Buenos Ayres,
are, in general, regular, except when influenced by
strong and constant winds, and the rise and fall is
about eight or ten feet. The bed of the river is of
hard sand, and when the tides are low no boats can
come near the shore, and many persons gain a living
by conveying goods and passengers from the boats
and craft to the shore, which is sometimes a quarter
of a mile. The following fact will illustrate the
power of the wind upon the water of this river.
Many years ago, during the contest with Spain, a
Spanish sloop of war was lying in the outer roads,
distant at least seven miles from the city. A succession
of strong pamperos,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in a few days laid bare
the whole ground of the inner harbor, and the vessels
and craft were left motionless and dry. The
winds still continuing to roll back the waters, even
the proud Spaniard, it was discovered, was laid bare
to the keel. Preparations were immediately made
by the patriots to attack her, in this her stationary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and perilous situation. A large body of artillerists,
with some pieces of heavy cannon, descended the
banks of the river, and were drawn along on the
sand by horses, and all the bustle of a march, and
preparation for battle, as on the tented field, were
seen on ground which the winds had cleared for
them, and over which the waves were wont to roar.
The astonished Spaniards saw with alarm and consternation,
the approach of an enemy on horseback,
where a few days before their ship had rode in ten
fathoms of water. They, however, prepared for a
desperate conflict, being resolved to defend their
ship, rather now their castle, to the last. Their
fate appeared almost certain; but fortune, for once,
favored them, and accomplished more in ten minutes,
than their own greatest bravery. The action
had commenced, when an unusual shout of triumph
from the deck of the Spaniard, caused the assailants
to look beyond, when with a dismay like that of
Pharaoh’s host, they beheld the surge rolling in and
roaring towards them! The battle ceased instantly—the
alarm was electric—the traces were cut from
the cannons—the guns were abandoned—and they
gallopped off in full retreat, with the sea in close
pursuit at their heels, and were precipitantly driven
up again, by this new enemy, from the invasion of
her possessions.</p>

<p>Monte Video is so called from the hill near the
entrance of the harbor. It is on the eastern side,
or ‘Banda Oriental,’ of the river. It has a good appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
from the water; but on traversing the
streets, there is nothing in the buildings to interest
or admire. The houses are low, covering a great
extent of ground; generally two stories in front,
and but one in the rear, forming a square and a
court or yard, in the centre. It is strongly fortified,
and the citadella or castle well garrisoned. The
city is now in possession of the Portuguese. In
1813 it was taken by the Patriots, who invested it
by sea and land for a long period, and cut off all
supplies. The famine was at last most distressingly
severe, and means at which humanity shudders,
were employed to gain a pitiful morsel to protract
a miserable existence. With true Spanish obduracy,
they refused all terms, till they sold for food all
they possessed, and parents even bargained their
daughters’ honor for a handful of bread. Every
thing eatable, and every living animal was devoured—horses,
cats and mules—and rats, with the immense
numbers of which, the city was once overrun,
either alive or dead, sold for a dollar each!
The Patriots did not long hold possession of the
city, for the Portuguese, who had always laid claim
to the lower or eastern side of the river, as the
southern bounds of the Brazil dominions, soon took
possession of it, and are still its masters. During
these occurrences, the Patriot General Artigas, of
Buenos Ayres, taking offence at some measures of
the government, ambitious and well informed, deserted
the common cause, and crossed the river to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Colonia, where he soon mustered a formidable body
of adherents, whom he urged to assert their independence
of all other powers, and form a separate
government, though they were before considered as
equally concerned in the common cause of the country.
Various detachments of troops were sent at
different times from Buenos Ayres, to subject them,
but without success, and but few returned. Artigas’
army being all mounted, would fly when success
was doubtful. Thus affairs remained till a
short time since, when this people, now called <i>gente</i>
of the ‘Banda Oriental,’ declared war against the
encroaching Portuguese, and attacked Monte Video.
The other provinces of the La Plata, deeply concerned
in the event, and being now on good terms,
assisted them, at first secretly, and at last openly,
against the common enemy. The Portuguese declared
war against the Patriots in toto, and the privateers
of the latter will greatly annoy the Brazilian
commerce, and probably be gainers by the struggle.</p>

<p>Ensenada is a small village, situate on the same
side with Buenos Ayres, and about forty miles below.
Several vessels generally lay here to take in
the jerk beef, which they carry mostly to the West
Indies. The manner of preparing this is simply by
cutting off the flesh of the slaughtered ox, and hanging
it in the air to dry. No salt is used, such is the
purity of the atmosphere in this delightful climate.
The entrance from the river to the village is, as
before related, through narrow, winding creeks, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the sides of which, innumerable varieties of the
feathered tribe, twittering from grove to grove and
from spray to spray, and expanding their brilliant
plumage to the sun, pour out their melodious strains
of praise to the great God of nature, whose goodness
is over all, and who delights in the happiness
of all his creatures. The people are sociable and
kind, and fond of the company of strangers, particularly
Americans, whom they often amuse by
their absurd and ludicrous questions respecting the
customs of other countries. The houses are low,
and built of earth and cane. The villagers are of a
dark complexion, but many of the women are fair
and have peculiarly sweet voices.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres, the capital of the provinces of the
Rio de La Plata, has an ancient and gloomy appearance
from the water; but the traveller, on
landing, finds much to be pleased with. The streets
cross each other at right angles, and are mostly
paved, with good side-walks. A street runs along
the beach, parallel with the river, nearly the whole
extent of the city, from which there is nothing to
shade the prospect of the pedestrian, who can enjoy,
in his early rambles, the pure and balmy breath
of the morning, (which are here, in this southern
latitude, particularly fine) and behold the great
king of day rising in the east, as from the bed of
the ocean. At the edge of the water, and below
the banks, he may see, too, from the earliest dawn
till noon, an immense number of black washer women,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
who line the whole extent of the shore, for all
the washing is performed in this manner. They bring
down upon their heads, large trays of clothing to the
river, and select a hole or natural excavation in the
tuskers of sand, which the ebbing tide has filled with
water, and which is covered with grass; and kneeling
upon the ground, with their pipes or cigars in
their mouths, commence their labor, which is by
beating instead of rubbing. They are, however, called
excellent in their business, and clean clothing is
considered by all ranks as an indispensable requisite.</p>

<p>During the warm months of summer, it is the
practice in which all ranks partake, to enjoy, after a
sultry and dusty day, the charming refreshment of
bathing. From an hour before sunset till dark, may
be seen, in the place before occupied by the washers,
a mixed multitude of many hundreds of both sexes,
and of all classes and ages, old men and children,
young men and maidens, promiscuously, and apparently
with much pleasure, performing their daily
and healthy ablutions.</p>

<p>But start not my fair reader! Though this mixed
assemblage, so employed, would appear to the
refined citizen of the north to savor of a want of
propriety, yet this luxury is enjoyed without any
deviation from decency or good breeding. Such is
the force of custom. Whole families, even the clergyman,
with his household, come down and enter
the water together. The females of all ranks generally
form separate parties, and are each attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to the water side by a female slave, who carries a
change of dress and a bathing habit. Then seated
on the grass and enveloped in a sheet, they disrobe
beneath their ample covering, slip on the <i>camisa</i>,
and trip into the water. There is no appearance
of impropriety, but all seem only bent on refreshing
themselves, and improving this ready and cheap
bath, after the heat and the dust of the day. Let
the following anecdote corroborate. I was one afternoon,
after my disaster, indulging in my favorite
recreation of swimming, at a time when the tide
was fast flowing and the waves beating to the
shore. I had reached some distance from the beach,
and had gained and stood resting upon a small eminence
at the bottom, with my head only above water.
I was desirous of trying my former feats under
water, and partly forgetting my disabled leg, I
plunged beneath the surface and swam a great distance
farther from the bank. On rising, I perceived
the tide was fast conveying me up the river, and it
would require my strongest efforts to recover the
shore, for the waves ran quick and short. I wanted
breath, and on the ability of my lame limb I had
placed too much dependence. I attempted in vain
to reach the Mole Head, and the lone sentry at the
end stood wondering at the motions of an object so
far within the stream. Finding my situation extremely
hazardous, and wishing no impediment, I
stripped off my nankin pantaloons, threw them to
the waves behind me, and made a last, anxious and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
resolute push to the land. I succeeded so far as
to reach a tusker or sand bank, at the bottom, and
on tiptoe I could keep my chin above water, and
balancing myself to the undulating swell of the
waves, I sufficiently rested myself, and luckily regained
my pantaloons, which came drifting along by
me. Taking a leg of this garment in my teeth, I
ventured another stretch, which brought me breast
high on the sand. I there drew on my covering,
and searched along for my dress. Various groups
had assembled on the beach during my aquatic excursion,
and I was concerned for the loss of my
clothes. A black, female slave at last came towards
me, whose mistress she said had sent her to
inform me that ‘she had removed my articles of
dress higher up the banks, to a safe deposite, as
the rise of the tide had threatened to sweep them
away.’ I sent back for answer, that ‘I felt infinitely
obliged to her, and would cheerfully, on a similar
occasion, reciprocate the favor.’</p>

<p>At the extremity of the city, on an elevated plain,
is the Plaza de los Toras, in the midst of which appears
a vast amphitheatre for exhibiting the barbarous
amusement, or rather cruel spectacle, of a Bull
Bait. These take place in summer, of the afternoons
of Sundays, and sometimes on other holidays. Their
description must be shocking to the feelings, but the
relation of the revolting scenes certainly may be perused,
when many of the softer sex are there the
applauding witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>The bulls are taken from the wild herds in the
interior, and they capture those of the most fierce
and wild character; in other words, those that will
give the most sport. These are driven by force and
stratagem into the adjoining stables, where their natural
ferocity is increased for several days, by starving
and goading, and otherwise tormenting them.</p>

<p>These exhibitions are generally fully attended,
and by a third part ladies. The circular and rising
seats of this amphitheatre, will contain and will afford
an equal view of the fight to ten or twelve
thousand. On one of these sights, I remember to
have seen ten bulls, six horses and one human
being killed, and another wounded, in the space of
three hours.</p>

<p>Every thing being ready, the bulls remained to
be driven across the area from the stables where they
were, to a smaller stable behind the amphitheatre,
where each was to be kept apart. The first stable
was not far from the amphitheatre, and a wall of
boards six feet high was put up the whole way
the bulls were to pass. At a quarter past four the
ten bulls were let into the area, in order to be put
into the stables at the opposite door; a man on
foot led a tame ox, which had been bred with the
bulls, before, to decoy them into these: they followed
the ox very quietly; but they do not always
do so. The three horsemen placed themselves at
some distance, one on each side of, and the other
opposite to the door at which the bull was to enter;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the tap of a drum was the signal to let a bull
in, and the man who opened the door got behind it
immediately.</p>

<p>During this last quarter of an hour the bulls had
been teazed by pricking them in the backs; this is
done by persons placed on the ceiling of the stables,
which was low, and consisted only of a plank laid
here and there, and between those planks was space
enough to use any instrument for that purpose.
The bulls were distinguished by a small knot of
ribbon fixed to their shoulders, the different colors
of which shew where they were bred, which is known
by the advertisements.</p>

<p>The bull made at the first horseman, who received
him on the point of the spear, held in the middle
tight to his side, and passing under his arm pit,
which making a wide gash in the bull’s shoulder,
occasioned him to draw back, the blood running in
torrents; the force with which the bull ran at the
man, was so great, that the shock had nearly overset
him and his horse. It was then another man’s
turn to wound the bull, as only one is to cope with
it at a time. They are never allowed to attack
the bull, but must wait the animal’s approach. The
bull trotted into the middle of the area, and stared
about, frighted by the clapping and hallooing of the
multitude. The man on horseback always facing
the beast, and turning when it turned; it then ran
at the horse, and got another wound in the breast,
and a third from the next horseman it attacked. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
was now become mad with pain, the blood issuing
from its mouth in streams, and faintness made it
stagger; its eyes ‘flashed fury,’ it pawed up the
ground, and lashed its sides with its tail; its breath
was impetuously discharged like smoke from its
nostrils, so that its head appeared as if in a mist.
A drum then sounded, which was a signal for the
horsemen to retire; and the men on foot began
their attack, sticking barbed darts into every part
of its body; the torture they inflicted made the
bull leap from the ground, and run furiously at one
of the men, who jumped aside; the bull then turned
to another man, who had just stuck a dart into
his back; the man took to his heels, and leaped
over the rails, where he was safe; in this manner
all the men continued tormenting the bull, who
could hardly stand through loss of blood. The
drum then sounded again, upon which the matador
appeared, with a cloak extended on a short
stick in his left hand, and in his right a two-edged
sword, the blade of which was flat, four inches
broad, and a yard long; he stood still, and at the
moment the bull in the agonies of despair and death,
made at him, he plunged the sword into the spine
behind the beast’s horns, which instantly made it
drop down dead. If the matador misses his aim,
and cannot defend himself with the cloak, he loses
his life, as the bull exerts all its remaining strength
with an almost inconceivable fury. The dead bull
was immediately dragged out of the area by three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
horses on a full gallop, whose traces were fastened
to its horns. A quarter of an hour was elapsed,
which is the time allowed for the murder of each
bull, five minutes to the horsemen, five to the footmen,
and five to the slayer.</p>

<p>Another bull was then let in; this was the wildest
and most furious of any I ever saw. The horseman
missed his aim, and the bull thrust his horns
into the horse’s belly, making the bowels hang out;
the horse became ungovernable, so that the man
was obliged to dismount and abandon it to the bull,
who pursued it round the area, till the horse fell
and expired. Four other horses were successively
killed by this bull, which till then, had only received
slight wounds, though one of the horses had kicked
its jaw to pieces. One of the horsemen broke
his spear in the bull’s neck, and horse and rider fell
to the ground; the rider broke his leg, and was carried
off. The footmen then fell to work again, and
afterwards the matador put an end to the life of
this valiant animal, whose strength and courage
were unavailing to save it. The third bull killed
two horses, goring them under the belly, so that
the intestines hung trailing on the ground. The
seventh bull likewise killed two horses. In this
manner were ten bulls massacred, and the whole
concluded in two hours and a half. The bull’s flesh
was immediately sold to the populace at ten quartos
per pound, which is about three pence.</p>

<p>When the last bull had been sufficiently wounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
by the horsemen, the mob were allowed to enter
the area; they attacked the bull on all sides, and
killed it with their knives and daggers. The bull
sometimes tosses some of these fellows over its
head.’</p>

<p>It should be remembered that in the interior,
around the circle, are double walls of oak, with
sally ports to the inner one, and a passage way
between them of three feet wide. These apertures
are sufficient to admit a man, but the <i>toro</i> cannot
enter. Through these, when hotly pursued, the
gladiator will escape, and the bull vents his rage on
the impregnable walls.</p>

<p>A powerful black bull was now let in, and made
instantly and without a stop, at the horseman, who
stood ready, twenty feet from the door, with his
spear firmly balanced and pointed to receive him.
The aim was true, but the point struck a bone,
which threw the horse upon his hind legs, and a
lance twelve feet long, of an arm’s thickness, was
shivered to pieces. The furious animal directly
pursued his advantage, and the horse was overthrown,
with the rider underneath him, whose case
was at this time extremely dangerous. Generally,
at the first wound of the spear, the bull will turn
off in another direction; but when they push on, as
those of a savage nature sometimes will, the horse
is thrown to the ground, and the spearsman’s situation
is, of course, very perilous. Such was the
wonderful strength of the bull in this case, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
struggling horse was lifted free from the ground by
the surprising power of his enemy’s horns, apparently
with the ease that an apple might be raised by
a fork. With difficulty, however, the rider extricated
himself, and attempted to fly. The gladiators
on foot ran to his rescue, and attempted, with their
bright colored mantles, to draw off the beast and
divert him from his purpose; but mad with rage,
and scorning their efforts, he jumped across the
prostrate horse, (drawing out his horns from his
body) and quickly pursued his biped foe. The latter
strained every nerve to reach the port-hole,
and one hand was even within it, but the horns of
his pursuer were the next instant in his ribs, and he
was impaled against the wall. He was an old man,
of a dreadful, cruel and relentless countenance; had
committed many unprovoked murders, and was once
condemned to be shot; but he chose rather to hazard
his life weekly against wild beasts in the ring, and
at last, having been twenty years so perilously employed,
was thus killed by a brute of a nature nearly
akin to his own.</p>

<p>At any feat of dexterity from the gladiator,
handfuls of dollars are sometimes thrown by the
rich spectators, which he deliberately picks up and
pockets, amid the shouts of ‘bravo!’ and the waving
of handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>A party will sometimes be seated and regaling
themselves at a table opposite the doors in the lists,
and a bull will be let out upon them, at which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
take to flight, with their bottles; except one bold
fellow, who leaps from the table, vaulting over the
bull’s horns, and lights straddling upon his back, facing
his tail, while chairs, table, &amp;c., are tossed about
his head. At other times, a solitary fighter will
be stationed on one knee, a few feet from the entrance,
with a short thick pike, very sharp, pointed
toward the door, with the butt end firmly fixed in
the ground, and wait the victim’s approach. This
is the most ready way of death; for the bull, driving
at the object, makes fiercely for the recumbent
and watchful foe, but drops before he reaches
him, for the pike head is buried in his brain. But
enough has been said of such heart-hardening scenes.</p>

<p>We will now turn to a custom of less savage, and
of a wholly different character—to the three holidays,
(which they zealously celebrate) called the
time of ‘Carnival.’ On these days, all business is
suspended, and woe to the landed stranger, of whatever
rank, who shall attempt to pass through the
streets of the city. The flat and low roofs of the
houses, are thronged with the women, whose slaves
have provided them with a large supply of water in
tubs, and with which they inundate the luckless
passenger below. The field officer on horseback,
and the poor <i>paysano</i> from the country, share alike
the effects of their deluging streams—the horsemen
will by speed attempt to escape the shower; but
tubs are emptied far in advance, from the watchful
throng above, in quick succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>The men are no less busy in the streets, annoying
the other sex, who are frequently pursued even
to their inner chambers. No offence can be or must
be taken, and no redress may be expected for mischief
done.</p>

<p>Many of the boys get a few rials, by the carrying
about in baskets and vending of egg shells, filled
with scented water and closed with wax, which the
men buy and pocket, and pelt every female with
them, who inconsiderately exposes herself to their
attacks. On a time like this, I once saw from my
lodgings, a party of a dozen, who assailed a house
a short distance below, on the opposite side of the
street. The windows have iron gratings from top
to bottom, by means of which, a person can ascend
and scale the walls and gain the roof. A part of
these sporters made this attempt, while the women
on the terrace, assisted by their slaves, discharged
their torrents and poured a flood on the heads of
the besiegers. They at last gained the terrace,
and the women fled to their lower apartments, pursued
by the enemy. Here they made a stand and
beseeched their invaders to proceed no farther, and
appealed to the honor and generosity of cavalleros,
not to invade the privacy of a lady’s chamber. The
appeal was effective, and they instantly desisted and
turned to retire; but seeing the enemy’s magazines
of water in large, low hogsheads, and the slaves who
had so obstinately repulsed them standing near,
they could not resist the temptation, and seizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
at once the screaming blacks, they deliberately
plunged them headlong into the vessels, and made
a speedy retreat.</p>

<p>The Theatre is a low and miserable looking edifice,
(though a new one was remaining unfinished) and
the performers at a par with the building. It is,
however, well attended, and the second or upper
range of seats is filled wholly with women. The
prompter’s head appears from an aperture in the
centre of the stage, with a lamp before him, and
whose voice is as audible as the players, who repeat
after him. I went once to see Shakspeare murdered,
and a scene in the afterpiece furnished a circumstance
that will afford a finishing picture to this
brief outline. The farce was called the ‘Haunted
House,’ the possessor of which wished to get rid of
his nocturnal and troublesome visiters. He had
summoned a procession of the holy order to purify
the premises; but the number of players, otherwise
fully engaged, being too small for this purpose, they
hit upon a very ready though <i>outre</i> expedient to
supply the deficiency. The church of San Domingo
stood on the opposite corner, and application was
there made, upon the pinch, for a supply of its disciples,
and a dozen were engaged at a rial a piece.
These shortly appeared upon the stage, in <i>propria
persona</i>, with belt and hood, and holy water, which
they sprinkled profusely around, chaunting ‘<i>Anda
te diablo</i>.’</p>

<p>There is a conveyance—a clumsy vehicle, drawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
by six horses—which leaves here once a month for
Chili, proceeding as far as the foot of the Andes.
Here, leaving their horses, the travellers are obliged
to mount on mules, as being more sure footed than
horses, and the passages over the mountains are, at
certain places, narrow and dangerous. The mule
only can be here rode with safety, on account of
the narrow passages winding along the sides of these
stupendous mountains. The astonished traveller,
when traversing along this ridge of frightful precipices,
beholds with dismay the yawning chasms beneath
him, where the least mis-step would infallibly
and irrecoverably plunge him in the fearful abyss below.
He follows, in breathless silence, the slow
and steady motions of his guide, who directs him to
slack his reins, to preserve perfect silence, to leave
the beast to its own guidance, and even if tottering
with dizziness, to close his eyes. These injunctions
need no repetition. Sometimes, in the lower places,
in thick and misty weather, the guides will lose the
track and wander till they regain it several days in
the snow. This a Dutch captain once told me was
his case, and he was much harrassed by the hard
riding, and sick even at the sight of a horse. The
passage is generally performed in about twenty
days, and the distance from Buenos Ayres to St.
Jago or Lima, is about four hundred leagues.</p>

<p>During the war with the royalists in the interior,
the Buenos Ayrean troops gained many important
victories. On these occasions the public square was
splendidly decorated, having arches formed of large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
trees, and on the branches in the centre of each of
these, were suspended lamps, and all the verdant
pillars were profusely supplied with large wax candles,
of a yard in length and of an arm’s thickness,
as well as the monument in the centre, which, when
lighted in the evening, produce the brilliancy of a
noon-day blaze.</p>

<p>A large platform was erected on one of these occasions,
in the midst of the square, and a grand
dance performed by a volunteer party of young
gentlemen, who were arrayed in the fashion of the
native Peruvians, having a flesh colored velvet dress,
with a band of large variegated feathers around
their heads, and another about the loins. They
went through the evolutions with much grace and
received great applause. The music was by a superior
band, which was placed on an elevated station
a short distance from them.</p>

<p>Horses, bullocks, dogs and sheep, in these vast
regions, run wild, in immense flocks and herds.
The swine are of small size, and always black. The
hunters, at certain seasons, form parties to procure
the hides and tallow of the wild cattle, and leave
the carcases to be devoured by the dogs.</p>

<p>These latter animals abound here in infinite variety
and numbers. Here may be seen the bull dog,
mastiff, pointer, water dog, terrier, spaniel, butcher,
shepherd, and ship dog, and sometimes all in a company
together. Some of them are of formidable
size, and often dangerous to the traveller, as I once
experienced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>On a lovely morning—during my lameness—in
the month of February, which is, in this latitude,
mid-summer, I took my fowling piece, and at day
break sauntered along the river side after game.
Before the sun rises, ducks are often plenty about
the little ponds at the extremity of the city. I
wanted to try my gun, and a drove of horses passing
slowly along enabled me to approach within
shot of a couple of large birds, like cranes, which
were stalking about in the water. I fired and killed
one and wounded the other, who made off with his
broken wing into the water, and the dead one I
drew up on the beach and hid him in the grass, resolving
to take him on my return. He measured
nearly five feet high, his legs being two feet long,
of a bright red; his neck was very long, and his
body covered with beautiful snow white plumage.
Proceeding, I found the ducks were, at this time,
unusually shy, and I had got but half a dozen. I
then put in a heavier charge and larger shot, in
hopes of touching a group of swans which I saw in a
small pond far ahead, but could not get near them,
and the sun being now up, I resolved to strike
across the fields and gain the high road to the city,
from which I had wandered nearly two miles. In
passing through some olive trees, I was started by
a rustling noise on my left, which caused me to turn
round, when I saw a large dog cutting through the
bushes, open mouthed, towards me! As I knew I
must fight, for I could not run, I grounded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
breech of my gun, and in an erect and steady attitude,
hoping to dismay him, awaited his coming up.
He soon did so, making directly towards me, and
trying, with great ferocity, to get a bite at my leg
behind. This I found he soon would succeed in,
and with a quick movement I altered my position,
and bending down, presented my piece with the
muzzle to his head, and following him round as he
endeavored to get behind me, he being within a few
inches, I hastily cocked and fired. He received
in his shoulder the whole charge of swan shot, yet
desisted not. Seizing then the barrel, I gave him a
blow with the butt of the gun, and forced him to
yield, when he set up a yell, and went howling upon
three legs. I instantly began to reload, for I saw a
second dog, equally formidable, approaching at full
speed, to assist his companion. The latter luckily
fell down as the second dog reached him, who smelt
for a moment about his prostrate comrade, then
turned tail and retreated.</p>

<p>The milk is brought in and cried about the city
by country boys, from seven to fourteen years old,
on horseback, who have a peculiar song of their
own, which I never could interpret, by which they
give notice of their approach. The milk is contained
in earthen jugs, placed in panniers made of
hide, on each side of the horse, holding three jugs
each. Notwithstanding the infinity of horses, I
never saw a mare in the streets of Buenos Ayres;
and a person riding one would be subject to derision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and abuse, as much as if he were mounted on a cow,
mares being kept only for breeding. Horses may
here be bought from one to twenty dollars, but
mules are much more valuable—not for being less
plenty, but because they are more difficult to tame,
and are truly of a most perverse and obstinate nature.
They are sometimes exported to the Cape
of Good Hope.</p>

<p>A vessel at sea had once a cargo of these beasts
on board, when a violent storm arose, in which they
broke from their fasts in the hold and ascended
upon deck; here they fell to kicking and biting, and
drove the mariners aloft, and the man at the helm
also fled. The bark carried away her masts, and
every thing threatened a wreck. At last, by the
help of some spars, they succeeded in pushing a
dozen of their mad passengers overboard; and driving
the rest below, regained command of the ship,
and put back for repairs.</p>

<p>Leopards, lions and wild cats are plenty, but I
do not think their natures so savage as those of Africa.
The leopards, which they call <i>tigres</i>, are very
large, and their beautiful skins are sold very cheap.</p>

<p>The ostriches are very strong birds, and will ride
a stout boy on their backs. They eat the most indigestive
substances, such as iron, stone and wood.
They are a coarse and dirty looking bird, and those
bright and tasty feathers they afford, are plucked
from their tails, where the long ones only grow.</p>

<p>Fruits of many kinds are plenty, especially melons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
grapes and peaches. These, as well as every
thing else in this most fertile country, are cultivated
with little labor, and the soil, I believe, would
produce, in abundance and perfection, every thing
desired, if the natives were not too careless and indolent
to bestow an effort to cultivate them. This
indolence, it has been said, may be attributed to
this very fertility of soil and softness of climate,
and as the earth here gives her increase without
much labor, they have not the necessity for toil as
those of a less yielding and more rocky region.</p>

<p>The general character of the people of these vast
provinces is mild and peaceable; they are rather
indolent, but hospitable in the extreme. They are
incessant smokers, and fond of a sip from a gourd
shell of the favorite <i>yerba</i>, rather than the stronger
liquors. This <i>yerba</i> is an indispensable beverage
with all ranks, and is instantly made by merely
pouring hot water (which is ever at hand) to the
<i>matte</i>, in the shell. They suck this very hot, through
a tube. This liquor is always offered to visiters,
and passed and repassed from guest to guest.</p>

<p>The women are generally below the usual stature,
with expressive black eyes, black hair, flute-like
voices, and dress and walk when abroad with much
circumspection, and flirt the fan—their constant
appendage—with exquisite grace and skill. The
complexions of some are tinged; but many, as I
before observed, are extremely fair; and some, I
have thought, approached, in form and feature, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
nearest to the perfection of beauty of any I had
ever seen. The country girls smoke cigars, and all
the sex are extremely fond of flowers, which they
rear in great profusion and in infinite variety. On
entering the hospitable and social dwellings of the
farmers, the matte cup, the cigar and a bunch of
flowers, are always presented. They are remarkably
temperate, and I have often seen the teamsters
at a pulperia or shop, passing around a single glass
of <i>aguadente</i>, or rum, which they would leisurely sip,
and which was amply sufficient for half a dozen
men.</p>

<p>The country carts, in which they transport their
produce from the interior, deserve notice. They are
the most awkward, heavy and singular vehicles ever
seen; and one of them passing through our streets,
would attract as much notice as a moving menagerie.
The cart is, in fact, about the height of a two
story house, the sides and roof formed of flags and
cane, but the bottom of hard and solid wood, which,
with the wheels, are monstrously clumsy. On the
front part of the wagon, under the arched roof, in
an elevated station, sits the driver. Over his head
is suspended and poised, a stout pole, of great
length, which extends from the cart to the foremost
of the six yoke of oxen; the end of this is spear-pointed,
and by moving the inner end, he can
touch and guide the leading yoke. In his hand he
holds a shorter pole, also pointed, with which he
governs the nearer cattle. Lashed on with hide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
strings, at the tail of the cart, is a large earthen
jar, of twenty gallons, to contain water. Thus furnished,
the machine moves at a slow pace, and as
they never grease the axles, the creak of the wheels
may be heard a mile distant.</p>

<p>When the caravan halts to encamp, they choose
a vacant and convenient place, and making a fire,
prepare for supper. They drive stakes into the
ground, on which, against the fire, they stretch a
piece of beef to roast, and then squatting in a circle
around, and with a kettle of matte only, thus
eat their simple but plentiful meal, with great relish,
without bread or salt, the remnants of which
last them through the next day.</p>

<p>At the vesper hour in the city, at sun set, the
stranger who walks the streets is amazed at the
sudden and simultaneous stop of the passing multitude
at the solemn toll of the bell. Looking around
him, he sees each uncovered passenger standing
like a statue, and every sound is hushed to silence.</p>

<p>In passing a church, all ranks lift the hat; even
the milk boy, and the abovementioned wagoner,
will simultaneously raise his <i>sombrero</i>.</p>

<p>Another equally superstitious and universal custom
deserves a passing notice. I was once, on a
fine afternoon, about sun set, seated at an extensive
table, in the spacious court yard of a coffee house,
amidst a vast number of officers, priests, and citizens,
partaking of a cup of their excellent <i>cafe solo</i>,
when suddenly was heard, at a distance, the tinkling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of a small bell, of a well known and peculiar sound.
Every one present, even to the waiters, hastily left
their seats, and thronging to the doors and windows,
fell upon their knees and awaited the approach of
the sacred host. A heavy, old fashioned coach,
profusely gilt, drawn by four mules, soon slowly appeared,
surrounded with a guard of four soldiers.
When abreast of the prostrate devotees, they all
fell to crossing themselves and repeating the <i>pater
noster</i>. This venerable carriage contains a holy
father, who goes to administer the sacrament of
extreme unction to some departing catholic. Frequently
in passing the street, I have been obliged,
at the sound of this reverenced bell, to step over
the heads of the kneeling group at the door, and
retreat from the indignity of kneeling to an old
coach and half starved mules. Obedience to this
rite, even from strangers, is rigidly enforced; and
an English naval captain, in full dress for a ball,
was once compelled to get upon his knees, and arose
vowing vengeance and leaving his scented cambric
handkerchief in the mud.</p>

<p>There is a nunnery of a very strict order in the
lower part of the city, and I once had lodgings
within the sound of its midnight bell, whose solemn
toll, at the dead hour of twelve, summoned the inmates
to their nightly devotions.</p>

<p>The ceremony of taking the veil is extremely
impressive and affecting. The individual, I believe,
has her own unbiassed choice, in thus retreating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
from the world, and the motives probably are loss
of friends, unhappy attachments, or, perhaps, a
melancholy disposition. The parent or guardian
pays a large sum to the institution, and the applicant
is admitted on trial. At the expiration of this
term, if she still resolves to embrace this solitary
life, she confirms her purpose in the assembled
church, by taking the veil.</p>

<p>In one case, a modest young creature, about the
age of sixteen, interesting, beautiful, and just
blooming into womanhood, was presented to the
gaze of the spectators, and appeared to attest to
this mournful resolution. As her attendants unbound
her hair, and the ample tresses fell upon her
shoulders, and the profusion of jetty ringlets were severed
from her reclining and finely formed head, there
arose in the mind a throb of painful feeling, from
the contemplation that this fair being was about
taking a last look at the bright scenes around her;
and that such youth and beauty should be immured
for life within the cold walls of a convent, and the
ends of creation be thus perverted by the iron sway
of tyrant custom.</p>

<p>These absurd ceremonies are derived from the
all pervading influence of the priests, who blind the
eyes of the people, and strive to keep them in ignorance
and error. Even the blessing and privilege
of possessing and reading the bible is denied them;
indeed, but few of the lower class can read at all.</p>

<p>To keep up their power, the priests use every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
means to prevent the spread of knowledge; for full
well they know, that should the minds of the people
be enlightened, common sense would prevail, and
they would awake to their impositions, and throw
off the debasing yoke of superstition; and priestcraft
would expire.</p>

<p>The multitude of padres, priests, friars, <i>clericos</i>
and church dependents, is incredible, and compose
a large portion of the population. They may be
seen in all places, with full, contented faces, under
their broad brimmed hats, reverenced and bowed to
by all; living upon the fat of the land, and one may
enter without ceremony all parts of any house at any
hour, without fear of interruption, on leaving his
hat and cane in the passage—‘he is confessing the
females, and must not be disturbed.’</p>

<p>There is one of the canine species here, as also
in Brazil, of a mouse color and without hair! At
Ensenada, I saw one of this kind; he was full grown,
though not larger than a rat. His body was of a
jet black, with a shining, smooth skin, without hair
or even down, excepting at the tip of his tail and
on the crown of his head. He was of a perfect and
handsome form, nimble in his motions, and would
bark and play with the manners of a lady’s lap dog.
I regretted that I could not obtain him, for I considered
him a very curious animal.</p>

<p>Fish in great plenty swarm in the river, and are
some of them of a beautiful appearance. In the
market, some may be seen for sale, four feet long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
with gold colored scales, some of a silvery hue, and
a great variety of other kinds, of which, a species
of fresh water cat fish are the most numerous, and
the cheapest.</p>

<p>Beef is sold without weighing, often at seventy
five cents per quarter; and a whole sheep, ready
dressed, for twenty five cents!</p>

<p>The slaves are always well used and fed, and the
majority appear to be as much at leisure, and full
as happy as their masters.</p>

<p>In the warm months of summer, between the
hours of two and four, a person may walk through
the city and not meet any moving object, a deathlike
stillness pervading the once bustling and crowded
streets. From the scorching rays of a verticle
sun, they retire to the recesses and shades, to enjoy,
in the arms of Morpheus, their favorite <i>siesta</i>, or
afternoon nap. At this time, none but dogs and
Englishmen, they say, (by which term they mean
all foreigners) are to be seen in the streets. The
shutters of the shops and houses are closed; the
muleteers and <i>peones</i> are snoring under the piazzas,
and the dogs are stretched out under cover; while
the shopkeeper is sleeping on his counter, and the
drayman under the shadow of his cart. I have said
they are <i>enjoying</i> their siesta, but there is one drawback
upon their comfort—<i>fleas</i>!—which here abound
in numbers without number. The habitations having
all brick floors, afford ample retreats for these
formidable disturbers of dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The <i>paysanos</i> are wonderfully expert on horseback;
yet having for a saddle, only a few pieces of square
cloth and leather, and triangular wooden stirrups,
with green hide straps, into which they hook the
great toe. Their method of catching the wild cattle
is very dexterous and singular. They are provided
with <i>lassos</i>, which is a strip of hide line thirty
feet long, with an iron ring and noose at one end, and
the other secured to the saddle, at the side of which
the coil is suspended. Having selected an animal
from the herd, the <i>guacha</i> takes the coil in his hand,
and swinging it fairly around his head a few times,
still in chase, throws out the noose with surprising
good aim, the distance of twenty feet, which falls
over the bullock’s head, and turning his horse,
draws tight and secures him by his horns; another
hunter in the rear then throws a second noose, which
entraps his hind legs, and by pulling in opposite directions,
the bull is easily overthrown.</p>

<p>The <i>estancias</i>, or large farms, in the interior, are
very productive and profitable, and the fertility of
the soil and the salubrity of the climate, in these
provinces, render the profession of the physician
little room for active service.</p>

<p>To conclude—the people, by which I mean the
middling and higher classes, are of amiable dispositions,
strong natural sense, eager for information,
and ardent lovers of liberty; highly honoring their
military chieftains, and often speaking with enthusiastic
pride of the heroic and beloved Bolivar.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
The march of mind, in these vast territories, must
keep pace with the rapid strides of liberty, and truth
and knowledge will ultimately prevail over despotism
and superstition. Living in this delightful clime, and
possessing this fruitful soil, with their devoted love
of country, and their ardent thirst for knowledge,
the speculative and contemplative mind of the philosopher
and philanthropist may look forward—piercing
the veil of futurity—and behold the native
of Paraguay and the rough Patagonian, enjoying
with the Chilian and the Peruvian, the invaluable
blessing of an enlightened government; and tribes
yet unknown, filling, at the sound of the Sabbath
bell, the consecrated temples of the Most High.</p>
